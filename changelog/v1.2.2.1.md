## [**1.2.2.1**] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

**AGENTS.md Structure & Efficiency Improvements**

Major restructuring of AGENTS.md for better organization and reduced verbosity while preserving actionable guidance.

1. **Section 2 Restructure** — Embedded VIOLATION RECOVERY box with Self-Check directly in POST-EXECUTION RULES (no longer separate sections)
2. **New Section 3: OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS** — Consolidated operational content:
   - Consolidated Question Protocol (multi-question format with round-trip optimization)
   - Gate Bypass Phrases
   - Compliance Checkpoints
   - Common Failure Patterns
3. **Section 6 Condensed (~50% shorter)** — REQUEST ANALYSIS & SOLUTION FRAMEWORK streamlined:
   - Compact 5-line Solution Flow (was 18-line ASCII diagram)
   - Core Principles as table with Anti-Patterns column
   - Single 7-item Pre-Change Checklist (was two redundant checklists)
   - Preserved: CLARITY Triggers, BIAS Reframe Technique, Citation format
4. **Section Renumbering** — All sections after new §3 renumbered (3→4, 4→5, etc.)

**Consolidated Question Protocol Enhancement:**
