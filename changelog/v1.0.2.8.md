## [**1.0.2.8**] - 2026-01-02

Reorganizes the workflows-documentation skill's asset folder structure for improved discoverability. Renames `assets/components/` to `assets/opencode/` and `assets/documents/` to `assets/documentation/` with 250+ path reference updates across 35+ files. Establishes new organizational principle for skill folder structure.

---

### Changed

1. **Asset Folders Renamed**:
   - `assets/components/` → `assets/opencode/` (OpenCode component templates: skills, agents, commands)
   - `assets/documents/` → `assets/documentation/` (document templates: README, install guides, frontmatter)
2. **250+ Path References Updated** across: `SKILL.md` · 7 reference files · 9 asset files · `AGENTS.md` · `write.md` agent · 7 command files · 2 install guides
3. **New Organizational Principle** established and documented:
   - `references/` = FLAT (no subfolders) for simpler AI agent discovery
   - `assets/` = Subfolders ALLOWED for grouping related templates
   - `scripts/` = Typically flat, subfolders OK for large collections
4. **Templates Updated** — `skill_md_template.md` with "Folder Organization Principle" section; `skill_creation.md` with folder guidance

---

### Fixed

1. **Duplicate File** — Deleted duplicate `INSTALL_GUIDE.md` in mcp-figma skill root
2. **Broken Paths** — Fixed 3 broken paths in mcp-figma (removed erroneous `/MCP/` from paths)

**Full Changelog**: [v1.0.2.7...v1.0.2.8](https://github.com/MichelKerkmeester/opencode-spec-kit-framework/compare/v1.0.2.7...v1.0.2.8)
