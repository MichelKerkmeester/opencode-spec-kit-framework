## [**1.0.3.0**] - 2026-01-04

Adds support for alternative specs folder location inside `.opencode/`. Memory files and spec folders can now be stored in either `specs/` (project root) or `.opencode/specs/` for projects that prefer keeping all OpenCode files in a hidden directory.

---

### New

1. **Dual Specs Location** — `specs/` OR `.opencode/specs/`: Both locations now supported for spec folders and memory files
2. **Precedence Rule** — Project root location takes precedence if both exist

---

### Changed

**File Updates (10 files)**

1. `context-server.js`: Path validation updated for dual locations
2. `memory-parser.js`: Scans both `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` directories
3. `generate-context.js`: Supports spec folder in either location
4. `config.js`: Updated path configuration
5. `workflow.js`: Dual location awareness
6. `collect-session-data.js`: Updated data collection paths
7. `directory-setup.js`: Creates folders in correct location
8. `folder-detector.js`: Detects specs in both locations
9. `MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md`: Documentation updated with examples

---

### Fixed

1. **Cross-Repo Symlink** — `INSTALL_GUIDE.md` in Public repo now points locally instead of to external project

---

### Upgrade

No action required. Existing `specs/` folders continue to work unchanged.

**Full Changelog**: [v1.0.2.9...v1.0.3.0](https://github.com/MichelKerkmeester/opencode-spec-kit-framework/compare/v1.0.2.9...v1.0.3.0)
