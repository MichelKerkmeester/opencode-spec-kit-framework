## [**1.0.7.0**] - 2026-01-23

Comprehensive multi-agent system upgrade introducing **7 specialized agents** with enterprise orchestration patterns. Adds Circuit Breaker isolation, Saga Compensation for rollback, Quality Gates at execution checkpoints, and dedicated agents for review, research, debugging, and session handover.

---

### New

**5 New Sub-Agents** (integrated into commands):
- **@research**: Technical investigation with evidence gathering → `/spec_kit:research` (Steps 3-7)
- **@speckit**: Spec folder documentation for Level 1-3+ → `/spec_kit:plan` (Step 3)
- **@review**: Code review with pattern validation (READ-ONLY) → `/spec_kit:implement` (Step 11)
- **@debug**: 4-phase methodology (Observe → Analyze → Hypothesize → Fix) → `/spec_kit:debug`
- **@handover**: Session continuation specialist (Sonnet default) → `/spec_kit:handover`

**2 Enhanced Agents**:
- **@orchestrate**: Senior orchestration with task decomposition, delegation, quality evaluation
- **@write**: Documentation generation and maintenance

**Enterprise Orchestration Patterns**

8. **Circuit Breaker** — Isolates failing agents with 3-state system (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN), 3-failure threshold, 60-second timeout
9. **Saga Compensation** — Reverse-order rollback on multi-task failures with logged compensation actions
10. **Quality Gates** — Pre/mid/post execution scoring with 70-point threshold rubrics
11. **Resource Budgeting** — 50K token default budget with 80% warning and 100% halt thresholds
12. **Conditional Branching** — IF/THEN/ELSE logic in task decomposition with 3-level nesting support
13. **Incremental Checkpointing** — Every 5 tasks or 10 tool calls for recovery

### Changed

**Command Integration**

1. **Agent Routing in Commands** — 4 commands now route to specialized agents:
   - `/spec_kit:research` → `@research` (Steps 3-7)
   - `/spec_kit:plan` → `@speckit` (Step 3)
   - `/spec_kit:implement` → `@review` (Step 11)
   - `/spec_kit:handover` → `@handover` (dedicated Sonnet agent)
