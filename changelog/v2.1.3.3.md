Memory indexing release-doc patch. This release clarifies the `/memory:save` manual retry example so full-folder re-index commands explicitly include workflow skill reference scanning (`includeSkillRefs: true`), reducing scan-scope ambiguity.

## Highlights

### Category: Documentation

- **Explicit scan scope in retry example**: Updated `/memory:save` docs to include `includeSkillRefs: true` in the full-folder re-index call.
- **Operator clarity**: Prevents confusion when validating skill reference indexing (`skillRefFiles`) after restart.

### Category: Commands

- **Source-scope consistency**: `/memory:save` retry guidance now matches `/memory:manage scan` source scope semantics for `references/` and `assets/` indexing.
