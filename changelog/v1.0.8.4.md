## [**1.0.8.4**] - 2026-01-24

Bug fixes for workflows-code skill restoring **3 missing minification scripts** and updating **25+ broken path references** across SKILL.md and deployment guides.

---

### New

1. **Minification scripts** — Created 3 scripts in `.opencode/skill/workflows-code/scripts/`:
   - `minify-webflow.mjs` (batch minification with manifest tracking)
   - `verify-minification.mjs` (AST-based pattern verification)
   - `test-minified-runtime.mjs` (mock browser runtime testing)

---

### Fixed

1. **Missing scripts directory** — Scripts now bundled with workflows-code skill instead of project root
2. **25+ broken path references** — Updated all `scripts/` paths to `.opencode/skill/workflows-code/scripts/`
3. **Phase 1.5 missing** — Added Code Quality Gate phase to SKILL.md overview tables
