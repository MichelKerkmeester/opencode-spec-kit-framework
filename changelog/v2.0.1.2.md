## [**2.0.1.2**] - 2026-02-14

> Create command dispatch security fix + defensive hardening — continuation of v2.0.1.1 (Spec 118 → Spec 008)

### Changed

Applied the same dispatch vulnerability fix pattern from v2.0.1.1 (spec_kit commands) to the 6 create commands. The root cause: OpenCode's Go runtime injects phantom agent dispatch instructions when it detects `@agent` references combined with `Task` in a command's `allowed-tools` frontmatter.

**Critical fix:** `create/skill.md` had the same two-factor vulnerability — `Task` in allowed-tools + `@write` agent references. Removed `Task` (not needed for slash command chaining) and added imperative guardrail block.

**Defensive hardening:** All 6 create commands now have execution protocol guardrails preventing phantom dispatch, even if `Task` is re-added in the future. All 6 YAML workflow assets marked as `REFERENCE ONLY`.

**Discovery:** `create_agent.yaml` exists but is never loaded by `agent.md` (orphaned file — inline workflow used instead). Flagged for future cleanup.

### Files

**6 command files hardened:**
- `.opencode/command/create/skill.md` — `Task` removed from allowed-tools + guardrail added (**critical fix**)
- `.opencode/command/create/agent.md` — guardrail added (no-YAML variant)
- `.opencode/command/create/skill_reference.md` — guardrail added
- `.opencode/command/create/skill_asset.md` — guardrail added
- `.opencode/command/create/install_guide.md` — guardrail added
- `.opencode/command/create/folder_readme.md` — guardrail added

**6 YAML assets marked:**
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_skill.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_agent.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_skill_reference.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_skill_asset.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_install_guide.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment
- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_folder_readme.yaml` — `REFERENCE ONLY` comment

### Upgrade

Drop-in replacement. Copy `.opencode/command/create/` to your project.
