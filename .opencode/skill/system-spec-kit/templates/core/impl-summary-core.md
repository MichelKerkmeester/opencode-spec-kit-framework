## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | [###-feature-name] |
| **Completed** | [YYYY-MM-DD] |
| **Level** | [1/2/3/3+] |

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

<!-- Voice guide:
     Open with a hook: what changed and why it matters. One paragraph, impact first.
     Then use ### subsections per feature. Each subsection: what it does + why it exists.
     Write "You can now inspect the trace" not "Trace inspection was implemented."
     NO "Files Changed" table for Level 3/3+. The narrative IS the summary.
     For Level 1-2, a Files Changed table after the narrative is fine.
     Reference: specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag/implementation-summary.md -->

[Opening hook: 2-3 sentences on what changed and why it matters. Lead with impact.]

### [Feature Name]

[What this feature does and why it exists. 1-2 paragraphs. Use direct address.
Explain what the user gains, not what files you touched.]

### Files Changed

<!-- Include for Level 1-2. Omit for Level 3/3+ where the narrative carries. -->

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [path] | [Created/Modified/Deleted] | [What this change accomplishes] |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

<!-- Voice guide:
     Tell the delivery story. What gave you confidence this works?
     "All features shipped behind feature flags" not "Feature flags were used."
     For Level 1: a single sentence is enough.
     For Level 3+: describe stages (testing, rollout, verification). -->

[How was this tested, verified and shipped? What was the rollout approach?]

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

<!-- Voice guide: "Why" column should read like you're explaining to a colleague.
     "Chose X because Y" not "X was selected due to Y." -->

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| [What was decided] | [Active-voice rationale with specific reasoning] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

<!-- Voice guide: Be honest. Show failures alongside passes.
     "FAIL, TS2349 error in benchmarks.ts" not "Minor issues detected." -->

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| [Validation, lint, tests, manual check] | [PASS/FAIL with specifics] |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

<!-- Voice guide: Number them. Be specific and actionable.
     "Adaptive fusion defaults to off. Set SPECKIT_ADAPTIVE_FUSION=true to enable."
     not "Some features may require configuration."
     Write "None identified." if nothing applies. -->

1. **[Limitation]** [Specific detail with workaround if one exists.]
