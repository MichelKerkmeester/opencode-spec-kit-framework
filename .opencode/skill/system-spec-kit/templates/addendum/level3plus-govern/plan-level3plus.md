## L3+: WORKSTREAM COORDINATION

### Workstream Definition

| ID | Name | Owner | Files | Status |
|----|------|-------|-------|--------|
| W-A | [Core Logic] | [Primary] | [file1.ts, file2.ts] | [Active] |
| W-B | [UI Components] | [Secondary] | [comp1.tsx, comp2.tsx] | [Active] |
| W-C | [Tests] | [Primary] | [test/*.ts] | [Blocked on W-A] |

### Sync Points

| Sync ID | Trigger | Participants | Output |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------|
| SYNC-001 | W-A, W-B complete | All agents | Integration test |
| SYNC-002 | All workstreams | All agents | Final verification |

### File Ownership Rules
- Each file owned by ONE workstream
- Cross-workstream changes require SYNC
- Conflicts resolved at sync points

## L3+: COMMUNICATION PLAN

### Checkpoints
