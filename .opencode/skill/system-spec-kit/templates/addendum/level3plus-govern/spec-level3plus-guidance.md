<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
Level 3+ (+Govern) is appropriate when:
- Enterprise-scale changes with high visibility
- Formal approval workflow required
- Compliance checkpoints needed (SOX, HIPAA, etc.)
- Stakeholder matrix with sign-off tracking
- Changelog with version history
- AI execution protocols for multi-agent coordination
- Complexity score 80-100

DO NOT use Level 3+ if:
- Standard complex feature without governance (use Level 3)
- No formal approvals required (use Level 3)
- Compliance not mandated (use Level 3)
- Single-agent execution sufficient (use Level 3)
