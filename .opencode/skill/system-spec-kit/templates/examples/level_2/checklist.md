<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.0 -->

<!-- EXAMPLE: This is a filled-in Level 2 checklist demonstrating how to document
verification evidence. Each item marked [x] includes evidence of completion. -->

## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
