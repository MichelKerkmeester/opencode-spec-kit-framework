## Known Limitations

1. **localStorage token storage** - XSS vulnerable; HttpOnly cookies planned for Phase 2
2. **No password reset** - Requires email service; separate spec/014
3. **No rate limiting** - Brute force possible; add before production traffic
4. **No refresh tokens** - Users must re-login after 24h; Phase 2 improvement
5. **No concurrent session limit** - Users can have unlimited sessions

---

## Risks Realized vs Mitigated

| Risk ID | Description | Occurred | Mitigation Applied |
|---------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| R-001 | JWT secret compromised | No | Stored in .env, not committed |
| R-002 | bcrypt vulnerability | No | Using latest version (5.1.1) |
| R-003 | XSS token theft | Accepted | Phase 2 mitigation documented |
| R-004 | Brute force | Accepted | Phase 2 rate limiting planned |
| R-005 | Database breach | No | bcrypt hashing protects passwords |
| R-006 | Security review delay | No | Scheduled early, parallel work |

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- **AI Execution Protocol** reduced coordination overhead
- **Workstream separation** enabled parallel development
- **Early security review scheduling** prevented launch delays
- **ADR documentation** made trade-off discussions efficient
- **Unit tests for utilities** caught edge cases early

### What Could Improve
- **UI effort underestimated** - Error states took longer than planned
- **Parallel opportunities missed** in API phase - could have parallelized login/logout
- **Database seeding** should be automated earlier in setup

### Recommendations for Future

1. **Increase UI buffer** by 20% for forms with validation states
2. **Create database seeding scripts** in setup phase, not as needed
3. **Parallelize more aggressively** in API implementation phases
4. **Consider authentication library** (Passport.js) for OAuth integration

## Deviations from Plan

| Planned | Actual | Reason | Impact |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 22 hours | 24 hours | UI error states | +9% effort |
| No auth.css | Created auth.css | Dedicated styling needed | +20 LOC |
| 4 test files | 5 test files | Split unit tests for clarity | Better organization |
| 2 sync points | 3 sync points | Added SYNC-003 for final verification | Improved quality |

---

## Follow-Up Items

### Phase 2 (Planned)
- [ ] spec/013-oauth-integration - Google/GitHub OAuth
- [ ] spec/014-password-reset - Email-based recovery
- [ ] spec/015-rate-limiting - Protect login endpoint
- [ ] Migrate to HttpOnly cookies (Security recommendation)
- [ ] Add refresh token mechanism

### Technical Debt
- [ ] Add rate limiting before production traffic
- [ ] Consider session storage for sensitive applications
- [ ] Implement concurrent session management

---

## Handoff Notes

**For On-Call Team**:
- Runbook: `ops/runbooks/auth.md`
- Alerts: Error rate spike on `/auth/*` endpoints
- Rollback: See plan.md L2: Enhanced Rollback section

**For Future Development**:
- OAuth should use same token service (src/utils/token.js)
- Password reset will need email service integration
- Rate limiting should use Redis for distributed state
