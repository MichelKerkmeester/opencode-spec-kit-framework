## 1. OVERVIEW

The `scripts/spec/` directory is the shell-based spec lifecycle layer.

## 2. CURRENT INVENTORY


- `create.sh` - create new spec folders from templates
- `upgrade-level.sh` - upgrade existing folders to `2`, `3`, or `3+`
- `check-placeholders.sh` - detect unresolved bracket placeholders after upgrades
- `validate.sh` - orchestrate modular validation rules
- `../tests/test-validation.sh` - validation test suite for exit code and rule behavior
- `check-completion.sh` - enforce completion gate before claiming done
- `calculate-completeness.sh` - compute checklist completion metrics
- `recommend-level.sh` - recommend level from task signals
- `archive.sh` - archive completed or stale specs

## 3. UPGRADE FLOW (SPEC124/128/129/136-139)


Canonical flow for upgrades:

```bash
# 1) Upgrade target level
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/upgrade-level.sh specs/003-system-spec-kit/130-memory-overhaul-and-agent-upgrade-release --to 3

# 2) AI auto-populate injected placeholder sections from existing spec context

# 3) Verify no placeholders remain
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/check-placeholders.sh specs/003-system-spec-kit/130-memory-overhaul-and-agent-upgrade-release

# 4) Run full validation (includes anchor checks)
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/003-system-spec-kit/130-memory-overhaul-and-agent-upgrade-release
```

`validate.sh` executes modular rules in `scripts/rules/`, including `check-anchors.sh` for ANCHOR tag pairing.


Phase-based spec folders (specs 136-139 and later) use `--phase` with `create.sh` and `--recursive` with `validate.sh`:

```bash
# Create a phase child folder inside an existing spec
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/create.sh --phase specs/003-system-spec-kit/138-hybrid-rag-fusion/001-phase-name

# Validate a phase parent and all its children recursively
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/003-system-spec-kit/138-hybrid-rag-fusion --recursive
```

<!-- ANCHOR:completion-gate -->
## 4. COMPLETION GATE


Before completion claims:

```bash
bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/check-completion.sh specs/003-system-spec-kit/130-memory-overhaul-and-agent-upgrade-release
```

## 5. NOTES


- `upgrade-level.sh` supports `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--verbose`, and `--keep-backups`.
- `create.sh` supports `--subfolder` for subfolder-based work inside an existing spec folder.
- `create.sh` supports `--phase` to create a numbered phase child folder inside a parent spec (e.g., `001-phase-name/`).
- `validate.sh` supports `--recursive` to validate a parent spec folder and all its phase children in one pass.
- `validate.sh` supports emergency bypass via `SPECKIT_SKIP_VALIDATION=1`.
