## 1. OVERVIEW
<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->

### The Problem Nobody Talks About

AI coding assistants are powerful but stateless. Every session starts from zero:

- Monday: "Here's how our auth system works..."
- Wednesday: Blank slate. Explain it all again.
- Friday: That spec folder you created? Lost in chat history.
- Next sprint: Same conversation, different day.

### The Solution

Spec Kit adds the missing layers: persistent memory, enforced documentation and cross-session context. Documentation is not optional. Gate 3 blocks file changes without a spec folder. Memory persists across sessions, models, projects, tools and runtimes.

Cross-workflow alignment is mandatory:
- All code created or updated must fully align with `sk-code--opencode`.
- All documentation created or updated must fully align with `sk-documentation`.

---

### What Makes This Different

| Capability | Basic Approach | Spec Kit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Decision Archaeology** | "Why did we build it this way?" | Causal graph traces decision lineage |
| **Token Usage** | Re-send same memories every query | Session deduplication saves ~50% on follow-ups |
| **Context** | Re-explain everything every session | Memory persists across sessions, models, projects, tools and runtimes |
| **Search** | Vector only | 4-channel hybrid with adaptive RRF fusion |
| **Ranking** | Score order | MMR diversity reranking + evidence gap detection |
| **Documentation** | "I'll document later" (never happens) | Gate 3 enforces spec folders on every file change |
| **Quality Gates** | Trust the AI did it right | PREFLIGHT/POSTFLIGHT validation at operation boundaries |
| **Handoffs** | 2-hour "what did you do" meetings | `/spec_kit:handover` produces a 15-line summary |

---

### Key Capabilities (Post Spec 138)

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **4-Channel Hybrid Search + Post-Fusion** | Primary scatter-gather across vector, FTS5, BM25 and causal graph; co-activation/session/causal signals are applied post-fusion |
| **Adaptive RRF Fusion** | Intent-weighted profiles replace fixed-weight RRF when `SPECKIT_ADAPTIVE_FUSION=true` |
| **Graph Intelligence** | Unified causal graph search for decision lineage and retrieval enrichment |
| **MMR Diversity Reranking** | Lambda mapped to detected intent for relevance-diversity balance |
| **Evidence Gap Detection** | TRM with Z-score confidence flags missing context before retrieval |
| **Multi-Query RAG Fusion** | Query expansion with domain vocabulary before scatter-gather |
| **FSRS Spaced Repetition** | Power-law decay with tier-based modulation (validated on 100M+ users) |
| **Semantic Memory** | Voyage AI 1024d embeddings stored in sqlite-vec |
| **Spec Folder Documentation** | Levels 1-3+ with CORE + ADDENDUM v2.2 template architecture |

---

### By The Numbers

| **Commands** | 13 (8 spec_kit + 5 memory) |
| **Importance Tiers** | 6 (constitutional to deprecated) |
| **Memory Types** | 9 (working, episodic, procedural, semantic, etc.) |
| **ANCHOR Coverage** | 533 anchors across 78 skill READMEs |

<!-- /ANCHOR:overview -->

## 2. QUICK START
<!-- ANCHOR:quick-start -->

### Create a Spec Folder

```bash
# 1. Find the next spec folder number
ls -d specs/[0-9]*/ | sed 's/.*\/\([0-9]*\)-.*/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1

# 2. Create your spec folder
.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/create.sh "Add user authentication" --level 2

# 3. Verify creation
ls specs/###-user-authentication/
# Expected: spec.md  plan.md  tasks.md  checklist.md  memory/  scratch/
```

### Use Commands (Faster)

```bash
# Full workflow (plan + implement)
/spec_kit:complete add user authentication :auto

# Planning only
/spec_kit:plan refactor database layer :confirm

# Research first
/spec_kit:research evaluate GraphQL vs REST
```

### Level Selection

| LOC Estimate | Level | What You Get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <100 | 1 | spec.md + plan.md + tasks.md + implementation-summary.md |
| 100-499 | 2 | Level 1 + checklist.md |
| >=500 | 3 | Level 2 + decision-record.md |
| Complex | 3+ | Level 3 + extended governance |

When in doubt, choose the higher level.

## 3. COMPONENTS
<!-- ANCHOR:components -->

### Component Map

| Component | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MCP Server** | `mcp_server/` | Hybrid search, graph intelligence, memory indexing |
| **Scripts** | `scripts/` | CLI tools for spec management and memory generation |
| **Templates** | `templates/` | Spec folder templates (Level 1-3+, CORE + ADDENDUM v2.2) |
| **References** | `references/` | Reference documentation (19 files) |
| **Assets** | `assets/` | Workflow assets, YAML configs, checklists |
| **Constitutional** | `constitutional/` | Always-surface project rules (never decay) |

### MCP Server (`mcp_server/`)

The cognitive memory engine. It provides 22 MCP tools over stdio for semantic search, memory management, causal graph operations, checkpoints and session learning.

**Key characteristics after spec 138:**
- 4-channel scatter-gather search pipeline
- Adaptive RRF fusion with 7 intent profiles
- Unified causal graph search for decision lineage
- MMR diversity reranking with intent-mapped lambda
- Evidence gap detection (TRM with Z-score confidence)
- Multi-query RAG fusion with domain vocabulary expansion
- All feature flags default to enabled via `isFeatureEnabled()`

See [mcp_server/README.md](./mcp_server/README.md) for full architecture, configuration and API reference.

### Scripts (`scripts/`)

CLI tools for day-to-day spec kit operations:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `spec/create.sh` | Create feature branch and spec folder; `--phase` creates parent + child phase folders |
| `spec/validate.sh` | Validation orchestrator (13 rules); `--recursive` validates parent and all child phase folders |
| `spec/calculate-completeness.sh` | Calculate completeness percentage |
| `spec/check-placeholders.sh` | Verify zero placeholders after upgrade |
| `spec/recommend-level.sh` | Recommend documentation level with phased decomposition detection |
| `spec/archive.sh` | Archive completed spec folders |
| `memory/generate-context.ts` | Memory file generation (source) |
| `templates/compose.sh` | Compose level templates |

**Memory generation is mandatory via script:**

```bash
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js specs/042-feature/
```

Never create memory files with the Write tool. The script enforces format and indexing consistency.

### Templates (`templates/`)

Spec folder templates using CORE + ADDENDUM v2.2 architecture:

```
Level 1:  [CORE templates only]        -> 4 files, ~455 LOC
Level 2:  [CORE] + [L2-VERIFY]         -> 6 files, ~875 LOC
Level 3:  [CORE] + [L2] + [L3-ARCH]    -> 7 files, ~1090 LOC
Level 3+: [CORE] + [all addendums]     -> 7 files, ~1350 LOC
```

Update CORE once and all levels inherit changes without duplication.

<!-- /ANCHOR:components -->

## 4. DOCUMENTATION LEVELS
<!-- ANCHOR:documentation-levels -->

### Progressive Enhancement

Every file modification requires a spec folder. Level is determined by estimated LOC, risk and complexity:

| Level | LOC Estimate | Required Files | Use When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | <100 | spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implementation-summary.md | All features (minimum) |
| **2** | 100-499 | Level 1 + checklist.md | QA validation needed |
| **3** | >=500 | Level 2 + decision-record.md | Complex/architecture changes |
| **3+** | Complexity 80+ | Level 3 + AI protocols, extended checklist, sign-offs | Multi-agent, enterprise governance |

> LOC is soft guidance. Risk and complexity can override. When in doubt, choose the higher level.

### When to Use Each Level

| Task | Level | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix CSS alignment | 1 | Simple, low risk |
| Add form validation | 1-2 | Borderline, low complexity |
| Modal component | 2 | Multiple files, needs QA |
| Auth system refactor | 3 | Architecture change, high risk |
| Database migration | 3 | High risk overrides LOC estimate |

### Spec Folder Structure

```
specs/042-user-authentication/
├── spec.md                    # Feature specification
├── plan.md                    # Implementation plan
├── tasks.md                   # Task breakdown
├── checklist.md               # QA validation (Level 2+)
├── decision-record.md         # ADRs (Level 3+)
├── implementation-summary.md  # Post-implementation summary
├── memory/                    # Context preservation (generated via script)
│   └── DD-MM-YY_HH-MM__topic.md
└── scratch/                   # Temporary files (git-ignored)
```

### @speckit Exclusivity

`@speckit` is the ONLY agent permitted to create or substantively write spec folder documentation (*.md files). Routing spec documentation to `@general`, `@write` or other agents is a hard violation.

Exceptions: `memory/` uses `generate-context.js`, `scratch/` allows any agent, `handover.md` uses `@handover`, `research.md` uses `@research` and `debug-delegation.md` uses `@debug`.

## 5. MEMORY SYSTEM
<!-- ANCHOR:memory-system -->

### Architecture

The memory system implements biologically-inspired cognitive features:

| Basic Chat Logs | This Memory System |
| --- | --- |
| Search: Ctrl+F (text only) | Search: 4-channel hybrid with adaptive RRF fusion |
| Prioritization: None | Prioritization: 6-tier importance (constitutional to deprecated) |
| Token Efficiency: Load everything | Token Efficiency: ANCHOR format (93% savings) + session dedup (~50%) |
| Recovery: Hope you backed up | Recovery: Checkpoints = undo button for your index |
| "Why" queries: Impossible | "Why" queries: Causal graph traces decision lineage |

### 6-Channel Search Pipeline

After spec 138, `memory_search` and `memory_context` use a scatter-gather architecture across six channels:

```
Vector (1.0x) + FTS5/BM25 (1.0x) + Graph (1.5x)
+ Co-Activation (+0.25) + Session Boost (capped) + Causal Edges (2-hop)
         |
         v
Adaptive RRF Fusion (intent-weighted profiles, k=60)
         |
         v
MMR Diversity Reranking (lambda mapped to intent)
         |
         v
Evidence Gap Detection (TRM with Z-score confidence)
```

### The Six Importance Tiers

| Tier | Boost | Decay | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **constitutional** | 3.0x | Never | Project rules, always-surface |
| **critical** | 2.0x | Never | Architecture decisions, breaking changes |
| **important** | 1.5x | Never | Key implementations, major features |
| **normal** | 1.0x | 90-day | Standard development context (default) |
| **temporary** | 0.5x | 7-day | Debug sessions, experiments |
| **deprecated** | 0.0x | Excluded | Outdated information |

### 5-State Memory Model

| State | Score Range | Behavior | Max Items |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **HOT** | 0.80-1.00 | Always retrieve | 5 |
| **WARM** | 0.25-0.80 | Retrieve on match | 10 |
| **COLD** | 0.05-0.25 | Retrieve if nothing else | N/A |
| **DORMANT** | 0.02-0.05 | Skip unless explicit | N/A |
| **ARCHIVED** | 0.00-0.02 | Exclude from search | N/A |

ARCHIVED memories are preserved but hidden from search. No deletion needed.

### FSRS Decay with Tier Modulation

Memory strength follows the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler power-law formula. After spec 138, importance tier applies a stability multiplier so higher-tier memories decay slower regardless of access frequency.

### Causal Memory Graph

Answer "why" queries by tracing decision lineage:

```typescript
memory_drift_why({ memoryId: 'abc123', maxDepth: 3 })
// Returns: { memory: {...}, causedBy: [...], enabledBy: [...], supersedes: [...] }
```

**6 Relationship Types:** `caused`, `enabled`, `supersedes`, `contradicts`, `derived_from`, `supports`

### Session Deduplication

| Without Dedup | With Dedup |
| --- | --- |
| Query 1: 5000 tokens | Query 1: 5000 tokens |
| Query 2: same 5000 tokens | Query 2: ~2000 tokens (skips seen memories) |
| Query 3: same 5000 tokens | Query 3: ~500 tokens (skips seen memories) |
| **Total: 15,000 tokens** | **Total: ~7,500 tokens (~50% savings)** |

### ANCHOR Format

```markdown
<!-- ANCHOR: decisions -->
## Authentication Decision
We chose JWT with refresh tokens because stateless auth scales better.
<!-- /ANCHOR: decisions -->
```

**Coverage:** 533 anchor tags across 78 skill READMEs.
**Token savings:** ~93% vs loading full documents.
**Common anchors:** `summary`, `decisions`, `metadata`, `state`, `context`, `artifacts`, `blockers`, `next-steps`

### 3-Source Indexing Pipeline

| # | Source | Location Pattern | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Constitutional rules | `.opencode/skill/*/constitutional/*.md` | Per-file metadata |
| 2 | Spec documents | `.opencode/specs/**/*.md` | Per-type multiplier |
| 3 | Spec memories | `specs/*/memory/*.{md,txt}` | 0.5 |

| `memory_save` | Index a memory file with PE gating |
| `memory_index_scan` | Bulk scan workspace (3-source pipeline, incremental) |
| `memory_update` | Update memory metadata and tier |
| `memory_delete` | Delete memories by ID or folder |
| `memory_validate` | Record validation feedback |

**Checkpoints**

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `checkpoint_create` | Snapshot current state with embeddings |
| `checkpoint_list` | List available checkpoints |
| `checkpoint_restore` | Restore from checkpoint |
| `checkpoint_delete` | Remove checkpoint |

**Session Learning**

## 10. TROUBLESHOOTING
<!-- ANCHOR:troubleshooting -->

### Common Issues

#### Spec Folder Not Found

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# List existing spec folders
ls -d specs/[0-9]*/

# Create spec folder if missing
./scripts/spec/create.sh "feature name" --level 2
```

#### Template Placeholders Not Replaced

```bash
# Find all placeholders
grep -r "\[YOUR_VALUE_HERE\]" specs/042-feature/

# Replace with actual content (check-placeholders.sh helps)
.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/check-placeholders.sh specs/042-feature/
```

#### Memory Loading Issues

```bash
# Verify memory folder exists
ls -la specs/###-folder/memory/

# Force re-index
memory_index_scan({ specFolder: "###-folder" })
```

#### MCP Server Issues

See [mcp_server/README.md](./mcp_server/README.md) for:
- Embedding model download failures
- Database corruption recovery
- Dimension mismatch after switching providers
- Empty search results diagnostics
- Feature flag rollback procedure

### Quick Fixes

| Problem | Quick Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Spec folder not found | `./scripts/spec/create.sh "name" --level 1` |
| Validation failing | `./scripts/spec/validate.sh <folder> --verbose` |
| Memory not indexing | `memory_index_scan({ specFolder: "..." })` |
| ANCHOR tag mismatch | Every `<!-- ANCHOR: name -->` needs matching `<!-- /ANCHOR: name -->` |
| Embedding API errors | Check API key or set `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=hf-local` |
| Empty search results | `memory_index_scan({ force: true })` |

### Testing

```bash
# Run full MCP server test suite (from mcp_server directory)
cd .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server && npx vitest run
# Expected: 4,770 tests passing across 159 files
```

## 11. FAQ
<!-- ANCHOR:faq -->

**Q: Do I need a spec folder for every file change?**

A: Yes for non-trivial file changes. Single typo fixes under five characters in one file and whitespace-only edits are exempt.

**Q: When should I choose Level 2 instead of Level 1?**

A: Use Level 2 when a change spans multiple files or needs verification evidence in `checklist.md`.

**Q: How do I recover context after a crash or compaction?**

A: Start with `/memory:continue`. If you need focused context, call `memory_context` with anchors such as `state` and `next-steps`.

**Q: Can I write memory files manually?**

A: No. Use `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js <spec-folder>` so format and indexing stay consistent.

**Q: Which tool should I call first for most retrieval tasks?**

A: Start with `memory_context`. It routes by intent, applies multi-query RAG fusion and picks the best retrieval path for the query.

**Q: Are all feature flags enabled by default after spec 138?**

A: Yes. All major flags including `SPECKIT_ADAPTIVE_FUSION`, `SPECKIT_CAUSAL_BOOST`, `SPECKIT_SESSION_BOOST` and `SPECKIT_GRAPH_UNIFIED` default to enabled via `isFeatureEnabled()`. See [mcp_server/README.md](./mcp_server/README.md) for the full flag table.
