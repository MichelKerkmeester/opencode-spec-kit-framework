## 1. OVERVIEW
<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->

The eval module provides measurement infrastructure for search quality evaluation. It includes baseline measurement (BM25 MRR@5), ceiling evaluation, ground truth datasets, edge density analysis, quality proxy scoring, K-value sensitivity analysis and an evaluation database for tracking metrics over time.

## 3. FEATURES
<!-- ANCHOR:features -->

### Evaluation Database (`eval-db.ts`)

Manages a SQLite database (`speckit-eval.db`) for tracking evaluation runs, metric snapshots and regression detection across sprints.

### BM25 Baseline (`bm25-baseline.ts`)

Measures BM25-only MRR@5 as the retrieval floor. Sprint 0 established the baseline at 0.2083.

### Edge Density (`edge-density.ts`)

Measures causal graph edge density to inform R10 escalation decisions. Added in Sprint 1 (T003).

### Ground Truth (`ground-truth-data.ts`, `ground-truth-generator.ts`)

Curated query-result pairs for measuring retrieval quality. The generator creates ground truth from the live corpus.

### K-Value Analysis (`k-value-analysis.ts`)

Grid search across RRF K values to identify optimal fusion parameters.
