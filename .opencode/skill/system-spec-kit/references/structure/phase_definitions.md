# Phase Definitions - Phase Decomposition for Complex Specifications

Phase decomposition system for organizing complex, multi-session specifications into parallel work streams with independent tracking and validation.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## 1. OVERVIEW

### What Are Phases?

Phases are a **behavioral overlay** on the existing documentation level system (Levels 1-3+). They are NOT a new level tier. Instead, phases decompose a single complex specification into multiple independent child spec folders, each representing a distinct work stream.

**Key distinction:** Levels describe documentation depth (how thoroughly to document). Phases describe work decomposition (how to split large work into manageable parts).

### When Phases Apply

Phases are suggested when a specification exceeds complexity thresholds that make single-folder management impractical. The phase system is most commonly used with Level 3 and Level 3+ specifications, though any level can technically use phases.

### Important Note

Phase decomposition is **workflow-assisted**: the AI can suggest phasing during spec creation, and scripts support phase-aware validation. The parent spec folder acts as the coordination point, while child phase folders operate as independent spec folders with their own documentation lifecycle.

## 2. PHASE DETECTION

### Complexity Scoring

Phase decomposition is triggered when a specification's complexity score meets the detection threshold. The scoring uses five dimensions:

| Dimension | Points | Condition |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Architectural complexity | 10 | Multiple systems, cross-cutting concerns, or architectural decisions |
| File count | 10 | Estimated files to modify > 15 |
| Lines of code | 10 | Estimated LOC > 800 |
| Risk level | 10 | Risk score >= 2 (moderate or higher) |
| Extreme scale | 10 | Exceeds any single dimension by 2x or more |

**Maximum score:** 50

### Detection Thresholds

Phase decomposition is suggested when BOTH conditions are met:

- **Score threshold:** complexity score >= 25
- **Level threshold:** documentation level >= 3

If only one condition is met, the specification proceeds as a standard (non-phased) spec folder.

### Suggested Phase Counts

| Score Range | Suggested Phases | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| 25-34 | 2 phases | Moderate complexity, split into two work streams |
| 35-44 | 3 phases | High complexity, three parallel streams |
| 45+ | 4 phases | Extreme complexity, maximum recommended decomposition |

**Note:** These are suggestions, not requirements. The user decides the final phase count and organization.

## 3. FOLDER STRUCTURE

### Phase Folder Naming Convention

Phase child folders use the standard 3-digit numbered naming convention:

**Format:** `[0-9][0-9][0-9]-[name]/` (e.g., `001-foundation/`, `002-api-layer/`)

### Parent Folder Structure

The parent spec folder contains a Phase Documentation Map in its `spec.md` that tracks all child phases:

```
specs/###-parent-feature/
├── spec.md                    # Contains Phase Documentation Map
├── plan.md                    # High-level coordination plan
├── tasks.md                   # Cross-phase task tracking
├── decision-record.md         # Architectural decisions (if L3+)
├── memory/                    # Parent-level context
├── 001-foundation/            # Phase 1
│   ├── spec.md                # Phase-specific spec (back-references parent)
│   ├── plan.md
│   ├── tasks.md
│   └── memory/
├── 002-api-layer/             # Phase 2
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   ├── tasks.md
│   └── memory/
└── 003-frontend/              # Phase 3
    ├── spec.md
    ├── plan.md
    ├── tasks.md
    └── memory/
```

### Parent spec.md: Phase Documentation Map

The parent `spec.md` includes a Phase Documentation Map section that lists all child phases with their status:

```markdown
## Phase Documentation Map

| Phase | Folder | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `001-foundation/` | active | Core data models and database schema |
| 2 | `002-api-layer/` | draft | REST API endpoints and middleware |
| 3 | `003-frontend/` | draft | UI components and state management |
```

### Child spec.md: Parent Back-Reference

Each child phase `spec.md` includes a metadata back-reference to its parent:

```markdown
---
title: Foundation Phase
created: 2026-02-20
status: active
level: 3
parent: specs/###-parent-feature/
phase: 1 of 3
---
```

This back-reference enables:
- Navigation from child to parent
- Validation of parent-child link integrity
- Phase-aware context loading

## 4. PHASE LIFECYCLE

### Lifecycle Stages

Phase-decomposed specifications follow a structured lifecycle:

```
1. CREATE
   └── Parent spec folder created
       └── Phase Documentation Map defined in parent spec.md
       └── Child phase folders created with back-references

2. PLAN (per child)
   └── Each phase gets independent plan.md and tasks.md
       └── Dependencies between phases documented in parent plan.md

3. IMPLEMENT (per child)
   └── Each phase implemented independently
       └── Phase status updated in parent Phase Documentation Map
       └── Memory saved per-phase for session continuity

4. VALIDATE (recursive)
   └── Each child phase validated independently
       └── Parent validates all children complete
       └── Cross-phase integration verified
```

### Phase Status Values

Phase folders use the same status values as regular spec folders:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Phase planned but not started |
| `active` | Phase currently being implemented |
| `paused` | Phase temporarily on hold |
| `complete` | Phase implementation finished |

### Cross-Phase Dependencies

Document dependencies between phases in the parent `plan.md`:

```markdown
## Phase Dependencies

Phase 2 (API Layer) depends on:
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Data models must be complete

Phase 3 (Frontend) depends on:
- Phase 2 (API Layer): API endpoints must be defined
- Phase 1 (Foundation): Shared types must be exported
```

## 5. VALIDATION

### PHASE_LINKS Rule

The `PHASE_LINKS` validation rule checks the integrity of parent-child phase relationships:

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Parent has Phase Documentation Map | WARNING | Parent spec.md should list all child phases |
| Child has parent back-reference | WARNING | Child spec.md metadata should reference parent |
| Phase folder naming | ERROR | Child folders must follow `###-name/` convention |
| Phase status consistency | WARNING | Parent map status should match child spec.md status |

### Recursive Validation

When validating a phased spec folder, use recursive mode:

```bash
./scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/###-parent-feature/ --recursive
```

This validates:
1. The parent spec folder against its declared level
2. Each child phase folder against its declared level
3. Cross-references between parent and children (PHASE_LINKS)
