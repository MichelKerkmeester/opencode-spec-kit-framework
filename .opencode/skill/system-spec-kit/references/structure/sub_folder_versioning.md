# Sub-Folder Versioning - Iterative Work Organization Pattern

Workflow-assisted pattern for organizing iterative work within existing spec folders using memory-based context preservation.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Enable clean separation of iterative work within a single spec folder while preserving historical context through memory files. Each iteration maintains its own memory directory for independent conversation history.

### Important Note

Sub-folder versioning is **workflow-assisted**: the AI can suggest it during Option A flows and `create.sh --subfolder` can create numbered sub-folders with `memory/` and `scratch/` automatically. Existing root docs are not auto-moved; archival/reorganization remains explicit.

### When to Use

- Working on distinct phases of the same feature
- Separating unrelated tasks within a parent spec folder
- Creating clear boundaries between implementation iterations
- Preserving context when returning to old work

## 2. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

```
specs/###-name/
├── 001-original-topic/   # First iteration
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── memory/
│       └── {timestamp}__.md
├── 002-new-iteration/    # Second iteration
│   ├── spec.md
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── memory/
│       └── {timestamp}__.md
└── 003-another-task/     # Third iteration (current, active)
    ├── spec.md
    ├── plan.md
    └── memory/           # Independent context
        └── {timestamp}__.md
```

## 3. WORKFLOW STEPS

### Step 1: Recognition

When selecting Option A (existing folder), the AI agent checks for root-level content and suggests sub-folder organization if appropriate.

### Step 2: User Decision

User decides whether to:
- **Create sub-folder**: Organize new work in a numbered sub-folder
- **Continue in root**: Keep working in the existing structure

### Step 3: Manual Organization

If creating a sub-folder, the user (with AI guidance):
1. Chooses a descriptive name for the sub-folder
2. Creates the folder structure manually or via `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/create.sh --subfolder`
3. Copies templates as needed

**Script-assisted example:**

```bash
.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/create.sh \
  --subfolder specs/003-system-spec-kit \
  --topic memory-overhaul \
  --level 3+ \
  "Wave 1 follow-up"
```

### Step 4: Path Tracking

Spec folder path passed via CLI argument to generate-context.js (stateless - no marker file).

<!-- ANCHOR:naming-convention -->
## 4. NAMING CONVENTION

- **Sub-folder format**: `{###}-{descriptive-name}` (script-generated or manual)
- **Numbers**: 001, 002, 003, etc. (3-digit padded, sequential)
- **Name rules**: lowercase, hyphens, 2-3 words (shorter is better)
- **Examples**: `001-mcp-code-mode`, `002-api-refactor`, `003-bug-fixes`

## 5. MEMORY CONTEXT ROUTING

- Spec folder path passed explicitly via CLI argument (stateless)
- Writes to specified sub-folder's `memory/` directory
- Each iteration has isolated conversation history
- Sub-folder creation also provisions isolated `scratch/` directories
- Root `memory/` preserved for legacy saves (backward compatibility)

## 6. EXAMPLE USE CASE

### Manual Sub-Folder Organization

**Scenario:** User wants to organize iterative work within an existing spec folder

1. **Initial State:**
   ```
   specs/007-auth-system/
   ├── spec.md
   ├── plan.md
   └── memory/
   ```

2. **After Manual Organization:**
   ```
   specs/007-auth-system/
   ├── 001-initial-implementation/    # Original content (manually moved)
   │   ├── spec.md
   │   ├── plan.md
   │   └── memory/
   └── 002-oauth-addition/            # New work
       ├── spec.md
       ├── plan.md
       └── memory/
   ```

**Key Points:**
- User manually creates and organizes sub-folders
- Original content can be moved to a sub-folder if desired
- Each sub-folder has independent memory/ context
- Numbering is sequential within the spec folder

### Step-by-Step Walkthrough

1. User runs `/spec_kit:complete` or similar
2. Gate 3 asks: "Spec folder?" → User selects **A) Existing**
3. User selects `specs/007-auth-system/`
4. AI suggests: "This folder has existing content. Would you like to organize work in a sub-folder?"
5. If yes:
   - User provides sub-folder name: "002-oauth-addition"
   - AI helps create the sub-folder with templates
   - Memory saves go to the sub-folder's memory/ directory
6. If no:
   - Continue working in root folder

## 7. BENEFITS

- Clean separation of iterative work
- Preserves all historical work (no data loss)
- Independent memory/ contexts per iteration
- Backward compatible (works with non-versioned folders)
- Flexible organization based on project needs

## 8. generate-context.js Integration

When using subfolder versioning, the memory save script (`generate-context.js`) fully supports nested paths.

### Supported Input Formats

| Input                                  | Resolution                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `003-parent/121-child`                 | Resolves to `{specsDir}/003-parent/121-child/`    |
| `121-child` (bare)                     | Searches all parents, requires unique match        |
| `specs/003-parent/121-child`           | Strips prefix, resolves nested                     |
| `.opencode/specs/003-parent/121-child` | Strips prefix, resolves nested                     |

### Memory File Location

Memory files are always saved to the CHILD folder's `memory/` directory:
- `specs/003-parent/121-child/memory/` (correct)
- `specs/003-parent/memory/` (wrong — parent-level, not child)

### Bare Child Ambiguity

If a child name like `121-audit` exists under multiple parents, the script requires the full path:

```
Error: Ambiguous child folder "121-audit" found in multiple parents:
  - specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-audit/
  - specs/005-anobel/121-audit/
Please specify the full path: parent/child
```
