# Changelog

## 2026-02-17

### Updated
- Realigned `SKILL.md` structure to closely match the Barter `sk-code--web` flow while keeping Public content anonymized and stack-domain based.
- Consolidated sections to a 9-section layout: `WHEN TO USE` through `QUICK REFERENCE`.
- Reworked `SMART ROUTING` to emphasize stack-first routing with weighted intent scoring, ambiguity handling, scoped resource guards, and recursive markdown discovery.
- Strengthened stack detection and explicit verification command mapping for `GO`, `NODEJS`, `REACT`, `REACT_NATIVE`, and `SWIFT`.
- Added stack-domain mapping and phase detection narrative aligned with the current references/assets tree.
- Updated related resources and quick-reference tables to reflect current anonymized stack folders and examples.
- Combined stack folder mapping content into a single `Resource Domains` section to reduce duplication in Smart Routing.

### Notes
- Alignment intentionally preserves Smart Router pseudocode-first ordering for validation compatibility.
