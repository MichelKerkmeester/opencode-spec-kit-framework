# SKILL.md File Templates - Creation Guide

Templates for creating SKILL.md files with proper structure, frontmatter, and required sections.

---

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## 1. OVERVIEW

### Purpose of SKILL.md Files

SKILL.md files define AI agent skills - reusable capabilities that extend an agent's functionality for specific domains or workflows. A well-crafted SKILL.md:

- **Triggers automatically** when relevant patterns are detected
- **Guides the agent** through specialized workflows
- **Maintains consistency** across conversations
- **Encodes expertise** in specific domains

### Template Overview

This guide provides **one comprehensive SKILL template** (Section 3) that covers all skill types from simple single-purpose tools to complex multi-mode orchestrators.

**The template is flexible:**
- **Simple skills**: Use core sections only (WHEN TO USE, HOW IT WORKS, RULES)
- **Skills with bundled resources**: Include detection context, merged resource domains/mapping, loading levels, and one authoritative Smart Router Pseudocode block; use `references/`, `assets/`, and `scripts/`
- **Multi-mode skills**: Expand WHEN TO USE and HOW IT WORKS sections by mode
- **All skills**: MUST include Section 2 (SMART ROUTING) with detection guidance + domain-based routing + pseudocode

**Target size**: 800-2000 lines for SKILL.md (<5k words total)

**Examples**:
- Simple: Unit test generator, documentation formatter (no bundled resources)
- Moderate: API client, specialized code reviewer (with references and assets)
- Complex: Workflow orchestrator, document quality pipeline (multi-mode with extensive resources)

### Progressive Disclosure Principle

SKILL.md architecture follows progressive disclosure:

1. **Metadata** (YAML frontmatter) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill activates (<5k words)
3. **Bundled resources** - Loaded as needed (unlimited size)

**Critical**: Keep SKILL.md <5k words. Move detailed content to `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/`.

### Document Type Requirements

**Enforcement Level**: STRICT (SKILL.md files require perfect structure)

**Required Elements**:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter with required fields
- ✅ H1 title with subtitle
- ✅ Numbered H2 sections (ALL CAPS)
- ✅ Section separators (`---`)
- ✅ No table of contents (forbidden in SKILL.md)

**Quality Targets**:
- Structure: 100/100
- Content quality: High (AI-evaluated)
- Overall: High (human/AI judgment)

## 2. FRONTMATTER REQUIREMENTS

### Required Fields

| Field | Required | Format | Example |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| `name` | ✅ | hyphen-case | `my-skill-name` |
| `description` | ✅ | Single line, 150-300 chars | `"Handles X when Y occurs"` |
| `allowed-tools` | ✅ | Array: `[Tool1, Tool2]` | `[Read, Write, Edit, Bash]` |
| `version` | ⭐ | Semver | `1.0.0` |

### Template

```yaml
---
name: sk-example
description: Example workflow skill demonstrating proper frontmatter format with specific capabilities, use cases, and key differentiators for AI agent discovery.
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
version: 1.0.0
---
```

### Key Rules

- **name**: Must match folder name exactly, hyphen-case only
- **description**: Third-person voice, single line, no `<>` brackets
- **allowed-tools**: Use brackets `[...]`, not comma-separated string

> **Complete Reference**: For validation rules, edge cases, array formats, and all document type frontmatter, see [frontmatter_templates.md](frontmatter_templates.md)

---

<!-- /ANCHOR:frontmatter-requirements -->
<!-- ANCHOR:a-retrieval-anchor-convention -->
## 2A. RETRIEVAL ANCHOR CONVENTION

Use retrieval anchors for every H2 section so section-level loading can target stable IDs.

**Format**:
- Open marker immediately before each H2: `<!-- ANCHOR:section-slug -->`
- Close marker immediately before the next H2 (or EOF): `<!-- /ANCHOR:section-slug -->`
- Slug rules: kebab-case from H2 text, strip numbering/emojis/punctuation
- Duplicate slugs: append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

**Example**:

```markdown
## 1. WHEN TO USE

[Section content]

## 2. SMART ROUTING
```

---

<!-- /ANCHOR:a-retrieval-anchor-convention -->
<!-- ANCHOR:skill-template-with-bundled-resources -->
## 3. SKILL TEMPLATE (WITH BUNDLED RESOURCES)

**Use for**: Skills with bundled resources (references, scripts, or assets)

**Target**: 800-2000 lines (SKILL.md <1000 lines, rest in resources)

**Size Constraints** (package_skill.py validation):
- Max 5000 words (3000 recommended)
- Max 3000 lines

**Required Sections**: WHEN TO USE, HOW IT WORKS, RULES (with ✅ ALWAYS, ❌ NEVER, ⚠️ ESCALATE IF)

**Recommended Sections**: SMART ROUTING, SUCCESS CRITERIA, INTEGRATION POINTS

### Template

---
name: example-skill
description: Example skill demonstrating proper template structure with specific capabilities for semantic code search and context preservation workflows.
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
version: 1.0.0

<!-- /ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
<!-- ANCHOR:smart-routing -->
## 2. SMART ROUTING

<!-- CRITICAL: Keep one authoritative Smart Router Pseudocode block in this section.
     Detection context may appear before pseudocode. Do NOT duplicate routing logic in separate lookup tables. -->

### [Primary Detection Signal]

[Document the first routing signal clearly, for example project detection, stack detection, or mode detection.]

```bash
# Example (replace with skill-specific detection)
[ -f "go.mod" ] && STACK="GO"
[ -f "package.json" ] && STACK="NODEJS"
```

### Phase Detection

```text
TASK CONTEXT
    |
    +- STEP 0: Detect [project/stack/mode]
    +- STEP 1: Score intents (top-2 when ambiguity is small)
    +- Phase 1: Implementation
    +- Phase 2: Testing/Debugging
    +- Phase 3: Verification
```

### Resource Domains

The router discovers markdown resources recursively from `references/` and `assets/` and then applies intent scoring from `INTENT_MODEL`.

Knowledge is organized by domain mapping:

```text
references/[domain]/...
assets/[domain]/...
```

- `references/[domain]/` for guidance, standards, and troubleshooting.
- `assets/[domain]/` for templates, checklists, and reusable outputs.
- `scripts/` for optional automation entrypoints when needed.

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level       | When to Load             | Resources                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ALWAYS      | Every skill invocation   | Baseline references          |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match  | Intent-mapped references     |
| ON_DEMAND   | Only on explicit request | Deep-dive standards/templates|

### Smart Router Pseudocode

- Section 3 (HOW IT WORKS): 200-300 lines
- Section 4 (RULES): 150-200 lines
- Section 5 (SUCCESS CRITERIA): 80-120 lines
- Section 6 (INTEGRATION POINTS): 100-150 lines

**Bundled Resources Structure (Monolithic)**:
```
.opencode/skill/skill-name/       # Note: .opencode/skill/ (singular, NOT skills)
├── SKILL.md (800-1000 lines)
└── Bundled Resources
    ├── scripts/          - Executable automation
    ├── references/       - Detailed documentation (flat or domain subfolders)
    └── assets/           - Templates and examples (subfolders OK)
        ├── opencode/     - OpenCode component templates (skills, agents, commands)
        └── documentation/ - Document templates (README, install guides)
```

**Graph Mode Structure** (for skills that benefit from node decomposition):
```
.opencode/skill/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              - Primary entrypoint (activation rules, routing, core behavior)
│   ├── when-to-use.md    - Activation triggers (required)
│   ├── rules.md          - ALWAYS/NEVER/ESCALATE (required)
│   ├── success-criteria.md - Completion gates (required)
│   ├── how-it-works.md   - Workflow and architecture
│   ├── smart-routing.md  - Intent scoring and resource routing
│   └── [domain].md       - Skill-specific topic nodes
├── references/
└── assets/
```


**Node file requirements**:
- YAML frontmatter with `description:` field on every node
- Each node scoped to one complete concept
- Required nodes: `when-to-use.md`, `rules.md`, `success-criteria.md`

**Folder Organization Principle**:
- **references/** = flat for small skills, domain subfolders for medium/complex skills
  - Flat example: `references/core_standards.md`, `references/validation.md`
  - Domain example: `references/backend/go/`, `references/frontend/react/`
- **assets/** = Subfolders ALLOWED when organizing many files by category
  - Group related templates together
  - Example: `assets/opencode/`, `assets/documentation/`, `assets/flowcharts/`
- **scripts/** = Typically flat, but subfolders OK for large script collections

**Native Discovery**:
- Skills auto-discovered from `.opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter
- Skill name in frontmatter MUST match folder name
- Skills appear as `skills_<name>` functions in OpenCode (hyphens → underscores)
- Invoke via `Read(".opencode/skill/<name>/SKILL.md")`

<!-- /ANCHOR:related-resources -->
<!-- ANCHOR:section-by-section-content-guidance -->
## 4. SECTION-BY-SECTION CONTENT GUIDANCE

### Section 1: WHEN TO USE

**Purpose**: Help the AI agent and users understand WHEN to activate this skill

**Section Boundary Rule**: "When to Use" = WHEN (triggers only). File references belong in Section 2 (Smart Routing).

**Essential Content** (ONLY these belong here):
- Activation triggers (what conditions activate this skill)
- Use case categories (2-4 categories)
- Specific scenarios (3-5 per category)
- Anti-patterns ("When NOT to Use")
- Keyword triggers (optional)

**Content that does NOT belong here** (move to Section 2 inline):
- ❌ File references
- ❌ Resource paths
- ❌ Resource tables

**Structure**:

### Activation Triggers

**Use when**:
- [Specific scenario with context]
- [Specific scenario with context]

**Keyword Triggers**:
- [Pattern that activates skill]

### Use Cases

### [Use Case Category]

[Content for use case]

### When NOT to Use

**Skip this skill when:**
- [Anti-pattern with rationale]

**Writing Tips**:
- Be specific: "Generate JSDoc for functions" not "document code"
- Include context: Why each scenario benefits from this skill
- Clear boundaries: Explicitly state what's out of scope
- Trigger patterns: What keywords/patterns auto-activate skill
- **NO file references** - those go in Section 2 (Smart Routing)

**Word Budget**: 100-200 lines

---

### Section 2: SMART ROUTING (Required for All Skills)

**Purpose**: Provide authoritative resource routing with scoped guards, recursive discovery, weighted scoring, and ambiguity handling.

**Critical Rule**:
```
❌ WRONG: Section 2 with no explicit detection logic (project/stack/mode)
❌ WRONG: Separate use-case routing tables or navigation guides
✅ RIGHT: Detection context + merged resource domains/mapping + loading levels + one authoritative pseudocode block

Section 2 typically contains five subsections:
1. Primary Detection Signal
2. Phase Detection
3. Resource Domains (including folder mapping)
4. Resource Loading Levels
5. Smart Router Pseudocode (authoritative)
```

**Placement**: After Section 1 (WHEN TO USE), before Section 3 (HOW IT WORKS)

**Essential Content**:
- **Primary Detection Signal** - explicit stack/project/mode detection rule
- **Phase Detection** - concise execution flow from detection to verification
- **Resource Domains** - merged domain mapping + concise domain-level paths
- **Resource Loading Levels** - ALWAYS/CONDITIONAL/ON_DEMAND table aligned to in-code behavior
- **Smart Router Pseudocode** - scoped guard + recursive discovery + weighted scoring + top-2 ambiguity handling

**Structure**:

<!-- /ANCHOR:section-by-section-content-guidance -->
<!-- ANCHOR:smart-routing-2 -->
## 2. SMART ROUTING

### [Primary Detection Signal]

```bash
# Example detection logic
[ -f "go.mod" ] && STACK="GO"
[ -f "package.json" ] && STACK="NODEJS"
```

### Phase Detection

```text
TASK CONTEXT
    |
    +- STEP 0: Detect project/stack/mode
    +- STEP 1: Score intents (top-2 on ambiguity)
    +- Phase 1: Implementation
    +- Phase 2: Testing/Debugging
    +- Phase 3: Verification
```

### Resource Domains

The router discovers markdown resources recursively from `references/` and `assets/` and then applies intent scoring from `INTENT_MODEL`.

```text
references/[domain]/...
assets/[domain]/...
```

- `references/[domain]/` for standards, architecture, and troubleshooting.
- `assets/[domain]/` for checklists and templates.

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level       | When to Load             | Resources                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| ALWAYS      | Every skill invocation   | Baseline references          |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match  | Intent-mapped references     |
| ON_DEMAND   | Only on explicit request | Deep-dive standards/templates|

### Smart Router Pseudocode

```python
# Authoritative router logic
# 1) Scope guard resource paths to current skill root
# 2) Discover markdown resources recursively
# 3) Score intents with weighted signals
# 4) Select top-2 intents when scores are close
# 5) Apply load levels and resource map
```

**Writing Tips**:
- Start Section 2 with the strongest detection signal for this skill.
- Keep resource domains and folder mapping in a single section.
- Keep conditions measurable and tied to resource paths.
- Keep `RESOURCE_MAP` and loading levels synchronized.
- Keep one authoritative pseudocode block in Section 2.
- Require scoped guards and recursive discovery in every router.
- Use top-2 ambiguity handling when intent scores are close.
- Avoid duplicate lookup tables and static file inventories.

**Word Budget**: 80-200 lines

---

### Section 3: HOW IT WORKS

**Purpose**: Explain the skill's workflow, architecture, and key patterns

**Essential Content**:
- Process flow (visual diagram using ASCII)
- Key capabilities or components
- Configuration or setup requirements
- Examples of primary workflows
- Flowchart supplements for complex logic (NEW - when logic blocks present)

**Structure**:

### [Primary Workflow Name]

[Brief explanation]

**Process Flow**:
\`\`\`
STEP 1: [Action]
   ├─ [Sub-task]
   └─ [Output]
   ↓
STEP 2: [Action]
   └─ [Output]
\`\`\`

**Example**:
\`\`\`[language]
# Realistic example
\`\`\`

**Writing Tips**:
- Visual flows help comprehension (use ASCII diagrams)
- Show, don't just tell (include code examples)
- Progressive detail: Overview → specifics → edge cases
- Link to references for deep dives
- **Flowchart Supplements**: Add visual flowcharts before/after complex Python/YAML logic (see below)

**Word Budget**: 150-300 lines

### Flowchart Supplements (For Complex Logic)

**Purpose**: Add visual clarity to complex Python/YAML logic blocks without removing structured code

**When to Use**:
- Complex conditional logic (nested if/else, multiple branches)
- Mode detection algorithms
- Multi-step decision trees
- Workflow routing logic
- State machine transitions

**Approach**:
- **Supplement, don't replace**: Keep existing Python/YAML code intact
- **Add flowcharts**: Place ASCII flowchart before or after code block
- **Visual aid purpose**: Help quick understanding of logic flow

**Structure**:

### [Logic Section Name]

**[Brief explanation of what this logic does]**

**Logic Flow**:
\`\`\`
START
  ↓
[Check Condition A]
  ↓
A True? ─── NO ──→ [Path B]
  │                    ↓
  │              [Process B]
  │                    ↓
  YES              [Continue]
  ↓
[Process A]
  ↓
RESULT
\`\`\`

**Implementation**:
\`\`\`python
def example_logic(input):
    """Original Python logic preserved"""
    if condition_a:
        return process_a(input)
    else:
        return process_b(input)
\`\`\`

**OR for configuration:**

\`\`\`yaml
mode_detection:
  trigger_patterns:
    ticket: ["$ticket", "create ticket"]
    story: ["$story", "user story"]
  defaults:
    mode: interactive
    depth: 10
\`\`\`

**Writing Tips**:
- **Keep code**: Don't remove Python/YAML - it's precise and complete
- **Add diagrams**: Flowcharts provide at-a-glance understanding
- **Placement**:
  - Flowchart FIRST if it aids comprehension before reading code
  - Flowchart AFTER if it summarizes complex code
  - Both before AND after for very complex logic
- **Consistency**: Use same ASCII flowchart style as Smart Routing Diagram
- **When to skip**: Simple 2-3 line logic doesn't need flowcharts

**Example Use Cases**:
- Mode detection with 5+ conditions → Flowchart + Python code
- YAML configuration with complex triggers → Keep YAML, add decision tree diagram
- Multi-step workflow routing → Flowchart showing paths, keep implementation code

**Word Budget**: Variable (adds 10-30 lines per complex logic block)

---

### Section 4: RULES (REQUIRED)

**Purpose**: Define mandatory behaviors, prohibited actions, and escalation triggers

**Validation**: package_skill.py requires this section with specific subsections

**Essential Content** (all three subsections REQUIRED):
- ✅ ALWAYS rules (4-7 critical requirements)
- ❌ NEVER rules (3-5 anti-patterns to avoid)
- ⚠️ ESCALATE IF (3-5 situations requiring user input)

**Structure**:

### ✅ ALWAYS

**ALWAYS do these without asking:**

1. **ALWAYS [requirement]**
   - [Why this matters]
   - [Implementation detail]

### ❌ NEVER

**NEVER do these:**

1. **NEVER [anti-pattern]**
   - [Why problematic]
   - [Alternative approach]

### ⚠️ ESCALATE IF

**Ask user when:**

1. **ESCALATE IF [ambiguous situation]**
   - [What's unclear]
   - [What clarification needed]

**Writing Tips**:
- Use semantic emojis with ALL CAPS for subsection headers (✅ ALWAYS, ❌ NEVER, ⚠️ ESCALATE IF)
- Alternative formats accepted: "ALWAYS", "NEVER", "ESCALATE IF", "ESCALATE WHEN"
- Be specific and actionable
- Explain *why* for each rule (rationale matters)
- Include implementation guidance
- Present options to user for ESCALATE IF cases

**Word Budget**: 100-200 lines

## 5. COMMON PITFALLS

For the complete list of 8 common pitfalls with before/after examples, see:
→ **[skill_creation.md § 5. COMMON PITFALLS](../../references/skill_creation.md#5-common-pitfalls)**

**Quick Summary:**
1. Generic descriptions → Be specific about capabilities
2. Bloated SKILL.md → Move details to references/
3. Missing bundled resources → Identify repeated code/docs
4. Unclear triggers → Specific activation conditions
5. Second-person language → Use imperative form
6. Platform-specific claims → Stay platform-agnostic
7. Multiline YAML descriptions → Keep single line
8. Redundant routing tables → Keep routing authority in pseudocode

### Writing Style Quick Reference

**DO**: Third-person voice (descriptions), imperative form (instructions), specific examples, rationale for rules

**DON'T**: Second-person ("You should..."), vague descriptions, duplicate content, angle brackets in frontmatter

## 6. QUALITY CHECKLIST & QUICK REFERENCE

### Pre-Packaging Checklist

**Before running package_skill.py:**

Frontmatter:
□ YAML frontmatter present and valid
□ Required fields: name, description, allowed-tools
□ Name is hyphen-case (matches directory)
□ Description uses third-person voice
□ Description is specific (not generic)
□ No angle brackets in description
□ allowed-tools lists all tools used

Structure:
□ H1 title with descriptive subtitle
□ Numbered H2 sections (1. WHEN TO USE, 2. SMART ROUTING, etc.)
□ H2 headings use ALL CAPS
□ Section separators (---) between major sections
□ No table of contents (forbidden in SKILL.md)
□ Proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
□ SMART ROUTING section placed after WHEN TO USE, before HOW IT WORKS

Content - Standard Sections:
□ WHEN TO USE section includes use cases + anti-patterns
□ HOW IT WORKS section explains workflow clearly
□ RULES section has ALWAYS, NEVER, ESCALATE IF
□ SUCCESS CRITERIA section defines completion
□ INTEGRATION POINTS section documents dependencies
□ All bundled resources referenced from SKILL.md
□ No duplication between SKILL.md and references/

Content - NEW Standardization (2025):
□ Section 1 (WHEN TO USE) contains ONLY activation triggers and use cases
□ Section 1 does NOT contain file-path routing logic
□ SMART ROUTING section exists (Section 2 - REQUIRED for all skills)
□ Section 2 includes explicit detection signal(s) (project/stack/mode as applicable)
□ Section 2 includes Phase Detection summary flow
□ Section 2 includes merged Resource Domains + folder mapping guidance
□ Section 2 includes scoped guard + recursive discovery markers
□ Section 2 includes weighted intent scoring + top-2 ambiguity handling
□ Section 2 includes Resource Loading Levels table
□ Section 2 includes one authoritative Smart Router Pseudocode block
□ Section 2 avoids duplicate routing lookup tables and static file inventories
□ Flowchart supplements added to complex logic blocks in Section 3 (where applicable)
□ Python/YAML code preserved (supplements, not replacements)
□ All ASCII diagrams use consistent style (when used)

Quality:
□ SKILL.md under 5k words (<3k preferred)
□ Concrete examples included
□ Rationale provided for rules
□ Language is third-person (descriptions) or imperative (instructions)
□ Consistent heading format
□ All code blocks specify language
□ Links work correctly
□ Section 1 contains ONLY triggers/use cases (NO file references)
□ Section 2 Smart Router Pseudocode load() calls include file refs with descriptions
