# Changelog

## 2026-02-17

### Updated
- Updated `assets/opencode/skill_md_template.md` Smart Routing guidance to match current skill routing patterns (detection-first context, merged Resource Domains/mapping, loading levels, and one authoritative Smart Router Pseudocode block).
- Updated `references/skill_creation.md` standards and examples to align with current routing structure and terminology.
- Replaced legacy "Resource Router" / "Activation Detection" guidance with the current section model used in active skills.
- Updated folder-organization guidance to allow domain subfolders in `references/` for medium/complex skills.

### Validation
- Ran `extract_structure.py` against both updated files successfully.
