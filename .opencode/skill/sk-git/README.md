## 1. OVERVIEW
<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->

`sk-git` is a unified orchestrator that manages the complete git development lifecycle through three phases: workspace setup (branch or worktree), commit hygiene (conventional commits) and work completion (integration plus cleanup). It provides smart routing to load only the resources relevant to the current phase.

Use this skill when starting new git-based work, following a complete git workflow (setup, work, complete), or when unsure which git sub-skill to invoke. It is not needed for simple one-off commands like `git status` or `git log`. Use Bash directly for those.

The skill enforces workspace choice (branch vs. worktree vs. current branch) by requiring explicit user confirmation before proceeding, preventing the AI from autonomously deciding a workspace strategy.

## 2. QUICK START
<!-- ANCHOR:quick-start -->

**Invoke the skill** via Gate 2 routing or directly:

```
skill_advisor.py "commit my changes" --threshold 0.8
```

**Keyword triggers:** `worktree`, `branch`, `commit`, `merge`, `pr`, `pull request`, `git workflow`, `conventional commits`, `finish work`, `github`, `issue`, `review`

**Argument hint:** `[worktree|commit|finish]`

**Typical flow:**
1. Phase 1: Create isolated workspace with `git-worktrees`
2. Phase 2: Commit changes with `git-commit` (Conventional Commits format)
3. Phase 3: Integrate work with `git-finish` (merge, PR, or discard)

## 4. FEATURES
<!-- ANCHOR:features -->

- **3-phase lifecycle:** Workspace Setup, Work & Commit, Complete & Integrate
- **Smart routing:** Loads only the resources needed for the current phase
- **Workspace choice enforcement:** Always asks user before choosing branch, worktree, or current branch
- **Conventional Commits:** Enforces `type(scope): description` format on all commits
- **Artifact filtering:** Excludes build files, coverage reports and other non-public artifacts from commits
- **Quality gates:** Pre-commit, pre-merge, pre-PR and post-merge checkpoints
- **GitHub MCP integration:** Programmatic access to PRs, issues and CI/CD via Code Mode
- **Parallel work support:** Multiple worktrees for simultaneous feature development
- **Session persistence:** Remembers workspace preference for the duration of a session

## 5. CONFIGURATION
<!-- ANCHOR:configuration -->

**Allowed tools:** `Read`, `Bash`, `mcp__code_mode__call_tool_chain`

**GitHub MCP prerequisites:**
- PAT configured in `.utcp_config.json` with `repo`, `issues`, `pull_requests` and `workflow` scopes

**Tool selection guidance:**

| Operation                  | Tool              |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| commit, diff, status, log  | Local `git` (Bash)|
| Worktree management        | Local `git` (Bash)|
| Create/list PRs            | `gh` CLI or GitHub MCP |
| PR reviews, issue CRUD     | GitHub MCP        |

<!-- /ANCHOR:configuration -->

## 6. EXAMPLES
<!-- ANCHOR:usage-examples -->

**New feature (full workflow):**
```
git-worktrees (create workspace) -> Code -> git-commit -> git-finish (merge/PR)
```

**Quick hotfix (current branch):**
```
Code -> git-commit -> git-finish (create PR, link issue)
```

**Parallel features:**
```
git-worktrees (feature A) -> Code A -> git-commit A
git-worktrees (feature B) -> Code B -> git-commit B
git-finish A -> git-finish B
```

**Commit message format:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow
fix(api): handle null user response
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

## 7. TROUBLESHOOTING
<!-- ANCHOR:troubleshooting -->

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| Merge conflicts can't auto-resolve | Escalate. Requires human decision on which changes to keep. |
| GitHub MCP auth errors | Check PAT expiry and scopes in `.utcp_config.json` |
| Worktree directory locked/corrupted | Run `git worktree prune` for manual cleanup |
| Force push to protected branch requested | Requires explicit user approval. Skill will warn. |
| CI/CD pipeline fails repeatedly | May indicate infrastructure issues beyond code |
| Branch divergence exceeds 50 commits | Consider incremental merging strategy |
