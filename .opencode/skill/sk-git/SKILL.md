# Git Workflows - Git Development Orchestrator

Unified workflow guidance across workspace isolation, commit hygiene, and work completion.

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### When to Use This Orchestrator

Use this orchestrator when:
- Starting new git-based work
- Unsure which git skill to use
- Following complete git workflow (setup → work → complete)
- Looking for git best practices (branch naming, commit conventions)

### When NOT to Use

- Simple `git status` or `git log` queries (use Bash directly)
- Non-git version control systems

### Keyword Triggers

`worktree`, `branch`, `commit`, `merge`, `pr`, `pull request`, `git workflow`, `conventional commits`, `finish work`, `integrate changes`, `github`, `issue`, `review`

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level       | When to Load             | Resources                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| ALWAYS      | Every skill invocation   | Quick reference baseline   |
| CONDITIONAL | If intent signals match  | Setup/commit/finish docs   |
| ON_DEMAND   | Only on explicit request | Extended patterns/templates|

### Smart Router Pseudocode

## 3. HOW IT WORKS

### Workspace Choice Enforcement

**MANDATORY**: The AI must NEVER autonomously decide between creating a branch or worktree.

When git workspace triggers are detected (new feature, create branch, worktree, etc.), the AI MUST ask the user to explicitly choose:

| Option                        | Description                              | Best For                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **A) Create a new branch**    | Standard branch on current repo          | Quick fixes, small changes      |
| **B) Create a git worktree**  | Isolated workspace in separate directory | Parallel work, complex features |
| **C) Work on current branch** | No new branch created                    | Trivial changes, exploration    |

**AI Behavior**: ASK before proceeding, WAIT for explicit selection (A/B/C), NEVER assume, RESPECT choice throughout. Once chosen, reuse preference for the session unless the user requests a change.

**Override Phrases**: `"use branch"` / `"create branch"` → Branch | `"use worktree"` / `"in a worktree"` → Worktree | `"current branch"` / `"on this branch"` → Current

### Git Development Lifecycle Map

Git development flows through 3 phases:

**Phase 1: Workspace Setup** (Isolate your work)
- **git-worktrees** - Create isolated workspace with short-lived temp branches
- Prevents: Branch juggling, stash chaos, context switching
- Output: Clean workspace ready for focused development
- **See**: [worktree_workflows.md](./references/worktree_workflows.md)

**Phase 2: Work & Commit** (Make clean commits)
- **git-commit** - Analyze changes, filter artifacts, write Conventional Commits
- Prevents: Accidental artifact commits, unclear commit history
- Output: Professional commit history following conventions
- **See**: [commit_workflows.md](./references/commit_workflows.md)

**Phase 3: Complete & Integrate** (Finish the work)
- **git-finish** - Merge, create PR, or discard work (with tests gate)
- Prevents: Incomplete work merged, untested code integrated
- Output: Work successfully integrated or cleanly discarded
- **See**: [finish_workflows.md](./references/finish_workflows.md)

### Phase Transitions
- Setup → Work: Worktree created, ready to code
- Work → Complete: Changes committed, tests passing
- Complete → Setup: Work integrated, start next task

### Skill Selection Decision Tree

**Workspace Setup (Phase 1)**:
- Starting new feature/fix? → **git-worktrees** (isolated workspace)
- Quick fix on current branch? → Skip to Phase 2

**Work & Commit (Phase 2)**:
- Ready to commit? → **git-commit** (analyze, filter, write Conventional Commits)
- No changes yet? → Continue coding

**Complete & Integrate (Phase 3)**:
- Tests pass? → **git-finish** (merge, PR, keep, or discard)
- Tests failing? → Return to Phase 2

### Common Workflow Patterns

**Full Workflow** (new feature):
```
git-worktrees (create workspace) → Code → git-commit (commit changes) → git-finish (integrate)
```

**Quick Fix** (current branch):
```
Code → git-commit (commit fix) → git-finish (integrate)
```

**Parallel Work** (multiple features):
```
git-worktrees (feature A) → Code → git-commit
git-worktrees (feature B) → Code → git-commit
git-finish (feature A) → git-finish (feature B)
```

<!-- /ANCHOR:how-it-works -->
<!-- ANCHOR:rules -->
## 4. RULES

### ✅ ALWAYS

1. **Use deterministic conventional commit format** - All commits must follow `type(scope): description` using the commit-message logic defined below
2. **Create worktree for parallel work** - Never work on multiple features in the same worktree
3. **Verify branch is up-to-date** - Pull latest changes before creating PR
4. **Use descriptive branch names** - Format: `type/short-description` (e.g., `feat/add-auth`, `fix/login-bug`)
5. **Reference spec folder in commits** - Include spec folder path in commit body when applicable
6. **Clean up after merge** - Delete local and remote feature branches after successful merge
7. **Squash commits for clean history** - Use squash merge for feature branches with many WIP commits

### Commit Message Logic (AI-Scannable)

Use this logic whenever the AI writes or rewrites commit messages.

1. **Subject format (required)**: `type(scope): summary`
2. **Type selection order (first match wins)**:
   - `merge`: merge commits (`Merge ...`)
   - `release`: version or release subjects (`vX.Y.Z`, `release`)
   - `docs`: docs-only changes or README/CHANGELOG-focused updates
   - `fix`: bug/security/hotfix/error correction
   - `feat`: new behavior, support, or capability
   - `refactor`: internal restructuring without behavior change
   - `test`: test-only updates
   - `chore`: fallback for operational or mixed maintenance work
3. **Scope selection order (first match wins)**:
   - `.opencode/skill/<name>/...` -> `<name>`
   - `AGENTS.md` changes -> `agents`
   - `README.md`-only changes -> `readme`
   - `opencode.json` or `.utcp_config.json` -> `config`
   - `.opencode/agent/...` -> `agents`
   - `.opencode/command/...` -> `commands`
   - docs-only set -> `docs`
   - fallback -> dominant top-level path or `repo`
4. **Summary normalization**:
   - Keep concise and specific
   - Remove duplicate prefixes like `feat(scope):` from legacy subjects
   - Avoid trailing period
   - Preserve key context tokens (version, skill name, issue id) when relevant
5. **Body format (optional)**:
   - Add only when context is non-obvious
   - Prefer:
     - `Context: <why>`
     - `Changes:` with 1-3 bullets
     - `Refs: <spec-folder|issue|PR>` when available
6. **Determinism rule**:
   - The same diff + metadata should produce the same commit subject every time.

### ❌ NEVER

1. **Force push to main/master** - Protected branches must never receive force pushes
2. **Commit directly to protected branches** - Always use feature branches and PRs
3. **Leave worktrees uncleaned** - Remove worktree directories after merge
4. **Commit secrets or credentials** - Use environment variables or secret management
5. **Create PRs without description** - Always include context, changes, and testing notes
6. **Merge without CI passing** - Wait for all checks to complete
7. **Rebase public/shared branches** - Only rebase local, unpushed commits

### ⚠️ ESCALATE IF

1. **Merge conflicts cannot be auto-resolved** - Complex conflicts require human decision on which changes to keep
2. **GitHub MCP returns authentication errors** - Token may be expired or permissions insufficient
3. **Worktree directory is locked or corrupted** - May require manual cleanup with `git worktree prune`
4. **Force push to protected branch is requested** - This requires explicit approval and understanding of consequences
5. **CI/CD pipeline fails repeatedly** - May indicate infrastructure issues beyond code problems
6. **Branch divergence exceeds 50 commits** - Large divergence suggests need for incremental merging strategy
7. **Submodule conflicts detected** - Submodule updates require careful coordination

<!-- ANCHOR:integration-points -->
## 7. INTEGRATION POINTS

### Framework Integration

This skill operates within the behavioral framework defined in [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md).

Key integrations:
- **Gate 2**: Skill routing via `skill_advisor.py`
- **Gate 3**: File modifications require spec folder question per AGENTS.md Gate 3 (HARD BLOCK)
- **Tool Routing**: Per AGENTS.md Section 6 decision tree
- **Memory**: Context preserved via Spec Kit Memory MCP

### Memory Integration

Use Spec Kit Memory MCP for context recovery and preservation:

```javascript
// Find prior git work in a spec folder
memory_search({ query: "git workflow", specFolder: "007-feature-name" })

// Search for related decisions across all specs
memory_search({ query: "branch strategy decisions", includeContent: true })

// After major commits or workflow completion
// Save context with: /memory:save or "save context to [spec-folder]"
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use `memory_search()` at session start to recover prior git context
- Save context after significant commits or before ending a session
- Reference spec folder in commit messages for traceability

## 8. RELATED RESOURCES

### Worked Examples

**New Authentication Feature**:
1. git-worktrees → `.worktrees/auth-feature` with `temp/auth`
2. Code OAuth2 flow → Run tests
3. git-commit → `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow`
4. git-finish → Merge to main → Cleanup worktree

**Quick Hotfix**:
1. Fix null reference bug on current branch
2. git-commit → `fix(api): handle null user response`
3. git-finish → Create PR → Link to issue #123

**Parallel Features**:
1. git-worktrees → `.worktrees/feature-a` and `.worktrees/feature-b`
2. Code both features in separate terminals
3. git-commit each → git-finish each sequentially

### Git Workflow Principles

```
ISOLATION: Use worktrees for parallel work
CLARITY:   Write conventional commits with clear descriptions
QUALITY:   Run tests before integration (git-finish gate)
CLEANUP:   Remove worktrees after completion
```
