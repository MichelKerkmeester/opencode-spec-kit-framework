# Code Standards - OpenCode System Code

Multi-language code standards and quality workflows for OpenCode system code, covering language detection routing, universal patterns, and completion checklists across JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Shell, and JSON/JSONC.

> **Navigation note:** This is a supplemental deep-dive index. `SKILL.md` remains the primary entrypoint for activation rules, routing logic, and core behavior. Use this index for focused content on specific topics.
