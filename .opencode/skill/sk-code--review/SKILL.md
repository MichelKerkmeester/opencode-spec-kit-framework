# Code Review Baseline - Stack-Agnostic Findings-First Review

Universal `sk-code` review baseline for any codebase, implemented by `sk-code--review` and paired with one `sk-code--*` overlay skill for stack-specific rules.

<!-- ANCHOR:when-to-use -->
## 1. WHEN TO USE

### Activation Triggers

Use this skill when:
- A user asks for code review, PR review, quality gate, or merge readiness.
- A workflow dispatches `@review` for pre-commit or gate validation.
- A user requests security/correctness risk analysis before merge.
- A user wants severity-ranked findings with file:line evidence.

### Keyword Triggers

`review`, `code review`, `pr review`, `audit`, `security review`, `quality gate`, `request changes`, `findings`, `blocking issues`, `merge readiness`

### Use Cases

1. Review-only pass: findings-first output with no code edits.
2. Gate validation: score + pass/fail recommendation for orchestrated workflows.
3. Focused risk pass: security, concurrency, correctness, or removal-focused review.

### When NOT to Use

- Feature implementation without review intent.
- Pure documentation editing where code behavior is not being assessed.
- Git-only workflow tasks (branching, rebasing, commit hygiene) without code-quality evaluation intent.

## 2. SMART ROUTING

### Primary Detection Signal

Review behavior follows a baseline+overlay model:

- Baseline (always): `sk-code` (implemented by this skill: `sk-code--review`)
- Overlay (exactly one `sk-code--*`):
  - OpenCode system context -> `sk-code--opencode`
  - Frontend/web context -> `sk-code--web`
  - Default/other stacks -> `sk-code--full-stack`

### Phase Detection

```text
TASK CONTEXT
    |
    +- STEP 0: Detect `sk-code` baseline + one `sk-code--*` overlay
    +- STEP 1: Score intents (top-2 when ambiguity delta <= 1.0)
    +- Phase 1: Scope and baseline checks
    +- Phase 2: Overlay alignment
    +- Phase 3: Findings-first analysis
    +- Phase 4: Output contract and next action
```

### Resource Domains

The router discovers markdown resources recursively from `references/` and `assets/`, then applies weighted intent scoring.

Knowledge is organized by domain mapping:

```text
references/review-core/...
references/review-risk/...
assets/review/...
```

- `references/` for baseline review flow, severity contracts, and risk checklists.
- `assets/` for optional reusable templates/checklists (if present in this skill).

### Resource Loading Levels

| Level | When to Load | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ALWAYS | Every invocation | `references/quick_reference.md`, `references/security_checklist.md`, `references/code_quality_checklist.md` |
| CONDITIONAL | Intent score indicates need | `references/solid_checklist.md`, `references/code_quality_checklist.md`, `references/removal_plan.md` |
| ON_DEMAND | Explicit deep-dive request | Full mapped reference set |

### Precedence Matrix

| Rule Type | Source of Truth | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Security/correctness minimums | `sk-code` baseline (`sk-code--review`) | Always enforced; never relaxed by overlay |
| Stack style/process conventions | Overlay skill | Overlay guidance overrides baseline generic style/process advice |
| Verification/build/test commands | Overlay skill | Overlay commands are authoritative for the detected stack |
| Ambiguous conflicts | Escalation | Ask for clarification; do not guess |

### Unknown Fallback Checklist

If intent/stack detection is unclear, request:

1. Review target scope (full diff, staged files, commit range, or explicit file list).
2. Primary risk class (security, correctness, performance, maintainability).
3. Architecture lens priority (KISS/DRY/SOLID strict or optional).
4. Stack/context (OpenCode system code, web/frontend, or other/full-stack).
5. Desired output mode (findings-only or findings + gated fix follow-up).

## 3. HOW IT WORKS

### Phase 1: Scope and Baseline

1. Inspect the review target (`git diff`, staged diff, file list, or commit range).
2. Load baseline standards from `sk-code` references in this skill (`sk-code--review`).
3. Detect one overlay skill by codebase/stack signals.

### Phase 2: Overlay Alignment

1. Load overlay standards from one stack skill only.
2. Apply precedence matrix:
   - Baseline security/correctness minimums always apply.
   - Overlay style/process/verification conventions win on conflicts.
3. If precedence cannot be resolved deterministically, escalate before scoring.

### Phase 3: Findings-First Analysis

1. Analyze for security and correctness first.
2. Analyze quality/performance and architecture concerns.
3. Analyze KISS/DRY and SOLID violations (SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP) with evidence.
4. Analyze removal opportunities with safe-now vs deferred classification.
5. Produce findings ordered by severity (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`).

### Phase 4: Output and Next Action

Required output contract:

```markdown
## Code Review Summary

**Files reviewed**: X files, Y lines changed
**Overall assessment**: [APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES / COMMENT]
**Baseline used**: [sk-code (`sk-code--review`)]
**Overlay skill used**: [sk-code--opencode | sk-code--web | sk-code--full-stack]

## Findings

### P0 - Critical
1. [path:line] Title
   - Risk
   - User impact
   - Recommended fix

### P1 - High
...

## Removal/Iteration Plan

## Next Steps
```

After reporting findings, request explicit next action before any implementation follow-up.
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-it-works -->

<!-- ANCHOR:rules -->
## 4. RULES

### ✅ ALWAYS

- Keep findings first; summaries follow findings.
- Enforce baseline security/correctness minimums regardless of overlay.
- Include file:line evidence for actionable findings.
- State assumptions when evidence is incomplete.
- Identify overlay skill used for standards alignment.

### ❌ NEVER

- Override stack-specific conventions with generic baseline style preferences.
- Approve code with unaddressed P0 security/correctness defects.
- Produce vague findings without concrete evidence.
- Mix unrelated cleanup into targeted fix recommendations.

### ⚠️ ESCALATE IF

- Stack detection is ambiguous and affects standards or verification commands.
- Baseline and overlay guidance conflict in a non-deterministic way.
- Large diff size prevents reliable severity assignment without narrowed scope.
- Requested remediation exceeds review scope and becomes architecture redesign.

## 6. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Review output is findings-first and severity-ordered.

<!-- ANCHOR:integration-points -->
## 7. INTEGRATION POINTS

- Primary review baseline for `@review` agents in `.opencode/agent/review.md` and `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/review.md`.
- Referenced by review-dispatch steps in `spec_kit` and `create` command YAML workflows.
- Complements, but does not replace, stack-specific skills:
  - `sk-code--opencode`
  - `sk-code--web`
  - `sk-code--full-stack`
