## 2. CODE GENERATION

### Single-File Application

Generate a complete single-file application from a description.

```bash
gemini "Create a [description] application in [language]. Requirements: [requirements]. Output a single complete file with all imports, error handling, and comments. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

**Example:**

```bash
gemini "Create a REST API server application in TypeScript. Requirements: Express framework, CRUD endpoints for a 'tasks' resource, input validation with Zod, error middleware, health check endpoint. Output a single complete file with all imports, error handling, and comments. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

### Multi-File Project

Generate a multi-file project structure with coordinated files.

```bash
gemini "Create a [description] project in [language] with the following structure: [features]. Generate all files including entry point, modules, configuration, and package manifest. Write files to [directory]. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

**Example:**

```bash
gemini "Create a CLI tool project in TypeScript with the following structure: command parser with yargs, config loader from YAML, logger module with levels, and main entry point. Generate all files including entry point, modules, configuration, and package manifest. Write files to ./src/cli-tool/. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

### Component / Module

Generate a single component or module that fits into an existing codebase.

```bash
gemini "Create a [language] [format] for [description]. Follow the patterns used in @./[file]. Include types, exports, error handling, and JSDoc comments. Output only the code." -o text
```

**Example:**

```bash
gemini "Create a TypeScript module for rate-limiting middleware with sliding window algorithm. Follow the patterns used in @./src/middleware/auth.ts. Include types, exports, error handling, and JSDoc comments. Output only the code." -o text
```

## 3. CODE REVIEW

### Comprehensive Review

Full code review covering correctness, style, maintainability, and performance.

```bash
gemini "Review @./[file] thoroughly. Check for: 1) Logic errors and edge cases, 2) Code style and naming consistency, 3) Error handling completeness, 4) Performance issues, 5) Maintainability concerns. For each issue found, provide the line reference, severity (critical/warning/info), and a suggested fix." -o text
```

### Security-Focused Review

Review focused on security vulnerabilities and attack surfaces.

```bash
gemini "Perform a security audit of @./[file]. Check for: 1) Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, command injection), 2) Authentication and authorization flaws, 3) Sensitive data exposure (hardcoded secrets, logging PII), 4) Input validation gaps, 5) Insecure dependencies or patterns, 6) eval() or dynamic code execution. Rate each finding as critical/high/medium/low severity." -o text
```

### Performance Review

Review focused on performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

```bash
gemini "Analyze @./[file] for performance issues. Check for: 1) Unnecessary re-renders or recomputations, 2) Memory leaks (unclosed handles, growing collections), 3) N+1 query patterns, 4) Missing caching opportunities, 5) Blocking operations in async contexts, 6) Algorithmic complexity concerns. Suggest concrete optimizations with expected impact." -o text
```

## 4. BUG FIXING

### Fix Identified Bugs

Fix a known bug with description and reproduction context.

```bash
gemini "Fix this bug in @./[file]: [description]. The expected behavior is [requirements]. The actual behavior is [description]. Apply the minimal fix without refactoring unrelated code. Explain the root cause and the fix. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

### Auto-Detect and Fix

Let Gemini scan a file for potential bugs and apply fixes.

```bash
gemini "Scan @./[file] for bugs. Look for: null/undefined access, off-by-one errors, race conditions, unhandled promise rejections, incorrect type coercions, resource leaks, and logic errors. For each bug found: describe the issue, show the fix, and explain why it is a bug. Apply all fixes. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

## 5. TEST GENERATION

### Unit Tests

Generate unit tests for a specific file or module.

```bash
gemini "Generate comprehensive [framework] unit tests for @./[file].

Use describe/it blocks with descriptive names. Output a complete test file." --yolo -o text
```

**Example (Jest):**

```bash
gemini "Generate comprehensive Jest unit tests for @./src/utils/validator.ts. Cover: 1) Happy path for each exported function, 2) Edge cases (empty input, null, boundary values), 3) Error conditions and thrown exceptions, 4) Mock external dependencies. Use describe/it blocks with descriptive names. Output a complete test file." --yolo -o text
```

### Integration Tests

Generate integration tests that test multiple components working together.

```bash
gemini "Generate [framework] integration tests for the [description] workflow. Test files involved: @./[file]. Cover: 1) End-to-end happy path, 2) Error propagation across layers, 3) Database/API interaction patterns, 4) Setup and teardown for test isolation. Write the complete test file." --yolo -o text
```

## 6. DOCUMENTATION

### JSDoc / TSDoc Generation

Add inline documentation to source code.

```bash
gemini "Add complete JSDoc documentation to @./[file]. For every exported function, class, method, and type: add description, @param with types and descriptions, @returns, @throws, and @example where useful. Preserve all existing code unchanged. Apply changes to the file. Start immediately." --yolo -o text
```

### README Generation

Generate a project or module README from source code.

```bash
gemini "Generate a comprehensive README.md for the project in [directory]. Analyze the source code and include: 1) Project title and description, 2) Installation instructions, 3) Usage examples with code snippets, 4) API reference for public interfaces, 5) Configuration options, 6) Contributing guidelines placeholder. Output as markdown." -o text
```

### API Documentation

Generate API documentation from route definitions or endpoint handlers.

```bash
gemini "Generate API documentation for @./[file]. For each endpoint: document the HTTP method, path, request parameters, request body schema, response schema with status codes, authentication requirements, and provide a curl example. Output as markdown." -o text
```

| `[features]` | List of features or capabilities | `"auth, logging, caching"` |
| `[requirements]` | Specific requirements or constraints | `"must handle 1000 req/s"`, `"readability and testability"` |
| `[framework]` | Framework name | `React`, `Vue`, `Express`, `FastAPI`, `Jest`, `Vitest` |
| `[language]` | Programming language | `TypeScript`, `Python`, `Go`, `Rust` |

### Placeholder Conventions

- **Single value**: `[file]` - replace with one value
- **List value**: `[features]` - replace with comma-separated list
- **Free text**: `[description]` - replace with natural language
- **Compound**: Some templates use the same placeholder multiple times for different values (e.g., `[language]` for source and target in translation). Replace each occurrence independently.
