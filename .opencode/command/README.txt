## 1. OVERVIEW

Commands are invoked as slash commands (e.g., `/create:skill`, `/memory:save`, `/spec_kit:plan`). Each command is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter that defines its description, argument hints and allowed tools.

Commands are organized into three groups:

| Group | Path | Commands | Purpose |
|-------|------|----------|---------|
| **create** | `command/create/` | 6 | Scaffold OpenCode components (agents, skills, READMEs, install guides) |
| **memory** | `command/memory/` | 5 | Memory system operations (save, search, continue, learn, manage) |
| **spec_kit** | `command/spec_kit/` | 7 | Spec folder workflows (plan, implement, research, debug, handover, resume, complete) |

One standalone command (`agent_router.md`) lives at the root level for routing requests to AI systems.

## 3. COMMAND GROUPS

### Create Commands

Scaffold OpenCode components using the `workflows-documentation` skill. Each command supports `:auto` and `:confirm` execution modes with corresponding YAML workflow files in `create/assets/`.

| Command | Invocation | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Agent | `/create:agent <name>` | Create agent with frontmatter, tool permissions, behavioral rules |
| Folder README | `/create:folder_readme <path>` | Create AI-optimized README with TOC and structure |
| Install Guide | `/create:install_guide <name>` | Create phase-based installation documentation |
| Skill | `/create:skill <name>` | Create skill with SKILL.md, references, assets, scripts |
| Skill Asset | `/create:skill_asset <skill> <type>` | Create asset file for existing skill |
| Skill Reference | `/create:skill_reference <skill> <type>` | Create reference file for existing skill |

### Memory Commands

Manage the Spec Kit Memory system for context preservation across sessions.

| Command | Invocation | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Context | `/memory:context <query>` | Intent-aware context retrieval with weight optimization |
| Continue | `/memory:continue` | Recover session from crash, compaction, or timeout |
| Learn | `/memory:learn <description>` | Capture learnings, corrections, and patterns |
| Manage | `/memory:manage <subcommand>` | Database operations (scan, cleanup, tier, health, checkpoint) |
| Save | `/memory:save <spec-folder>` | Save conversation context with semantic indexing |

### Spec Kit Commands

Structured workflows for the spec folder development lifecycle.

| Command | Invocation | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Complete | `/spec_kit:complete <description>` | Full end-to-end workflow (14+ steps) |
| Debug | `/spec_kit:debug [spec-folder]` | Delegate debugging to specialized sub-agent |
| Handover | `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder]` | Create session handover for continuation |
| Implement | `/spec_kit:implement <spec-folder>` | Execute pre-planned work (requires plan.md) |
| Plan | `/spec_kit:plan <description>` | Planning workflow (spec through plan only) |
| Research | `/spec_kit:research <topic>` | Technical investigation and documentation |
| Resume | `/spec_kit:resume [spec-folder]` | Resume work on existing spec folder |

## 4. USAGE

### Basic Invocation

```
/create:skill my-new-skill "Description of what it does"
/memory:save specs/007-feature
/spec_kit:plan "Add user authentication" :auto
```

### With Execution Modes

```
# Auto mode: execute without approval prompts
/spec_kit:complete "Add dark mode" :auto

# Confirm mode: pause at each step for approval
/create:agent my-agent :confirm

# With research phase
/spec_kit:complete "New feature" :with-research

# With auto-debug on failure
/spec_kit:complete "Fix auth" :auto-debug
```

### Agent Router

```
# Route a request through intelligent agent selection
/agent_router "Build a new authentication system"
```

## 5. EXECUTION MODES

Most commands in `create/` and `spec_kit/` support two execution modes controlled by a suffix argument.

| Mode | Suffix | Behavior |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Auto** | `:auto` | Execute all steps without approval prompts |
| **Confirm** | `:confirm` | Pause at each step and wait for user approval |

Each mode maps to a separate YAML workflow file in the command's `assets/` folder:
- Auto: `<command>_auto.yaml`
- Confirm: `<command>_confirm.yaml`

The `spec_kit:complete` command supports two additional modes:
- `:with-research` adds a research phase before planning
- `:auto-debug` enables automatic debug delegation on failure

## 6. TROUBLESHOOTING

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Command not recognized | Wrong invocation format | Use `/<group>:<command>` format (e.g., `/memory:save`) |
| Missing arguments error | Required argument not provided | Check the `argument-hint` in the command's frontmatter |
| YAML workflow not found | Missing asset file | Verify `assets/` folder contains the corresponding YAML |
| Tool permission denied | Command lacks required tool | Check `allowed-tools` in command frontmatter |
| Agent router has no request | Empty arguments passed | Provide an explicit request string |
