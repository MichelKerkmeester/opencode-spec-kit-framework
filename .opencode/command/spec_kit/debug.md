> ⚠️ **EXECUTION PROTOCOL — READ FIRST**
>
> This command runs a structured YAML workflow. Do NOT dispatch agents from this document.
>
> **YOUR FIRST ACTION:**
> 1. Determine execution mode from user input (`:auto` or `:confirm`)
> 2. Load the corresponding YAML file from `assets/`:
>    - Auto mode → `spec_kit_debug_auto.yaml`
>    - Confirm mode → `spec_kit_debug_confirm.yaml`
> 3. Execute the YAML workflow step by step
>
> All content below is reference context for the YAML workflow. Do not treat reference sections, routing tables, or dispatch templates as direct instructions to execute.

## CONSTRAINTS

- **DO NOT** dispatch any agent (`@debug`, `@review`, `@handover`, `@speckit`) from this document
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@review` to review this workflow or command prompt
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@debug` from this document — the YAML workflow handles dispatch at Step 3
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@handover` unless the user explicitly requests it post-resolution
- **ALL** agent dispatching is handled by the YAML workflow steps — this document is setup + reference only
- **FIRST ACTION** is always: load the YAML file, then execute it step by step

# SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT - ONE USER INTERACTION

This workflow uses a SINGLE consolidated prompt to gather ALL required inputs in ONE user interaction. Dispatch mode selection is MANDATORY.

---

## 1. UNIFIED SETUP PHASE

**STATUS: BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT:

1. CHECK mode suffix:
   ├─ ":auto"    → execution_mode = "AUTONOMOUS" (omit Q_exec)
   ├─ ":confirm" → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE" (omit Q_exec)
   └─ No suffix  → execution_mode = "ASK" (include Q_exec)

2. CHECK for spec folder in $ARGUMENTS:
   - IF has path -> validate and store
   - IF empty -> auto-detect: Glob("specs/**/memory/*.{md,txt}"), sort by mtime, take first

3. Auto-detect result:
   - Found: spec_path = extracted, detection_method = "recent"
   - Not found: detection_method = "none" (include Q0)

4. GATHER ERROR CONTEXT from conversation (background scan):
   - Scan for: error messages, stack traces, affected files, previous attempts
   - Found: store as error_message, affected_files, previous_attempts
   - Not found: include Q1 in prompt

5. ASK user (include only applicable questions):

   Q0. Spec Folder (if not detected/provided):
      Available: [list if found]
      A) Use: [most recent]  B) Different folder  C) Ad-hoc mode  D) Cancel

   Q1. Error Context (if not found in conversation):
      Provide: error message/behavior, affected file(s), what you tried

   Q2. Execution Mode (if no suffix):
      A) Autonomous - all steps without approval
      B) Interactive - pause at each step

   Q3. Dispatch Mode (required):
      A) Single Agent (Recommended)
      B) Multi-Agent (1+2)
      C) Multi-Agent (1+3)

   Reply with answers, e.g.: "A, A, A, A" or "A, [error desc], A, B"

6. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

7. Parse and store:
   - spec_path, detection_method, error_message, affected_files, previous_attempts
   - execution_mode = [AUTONOMOUS/INTERACTIVE from suffix or Q2]
   - dispatch_mode = [single/multi_small/multi_large from Q3]

8. IF dispatch_mode is multi_*:
   - Orchestrator handles OBSERVE + FIX phases
   - Workers handle parallel hypothesis generation in ANALYZE phase

9. SET STATUS: PASSED

HARD STOP: DO NOT proceed until user answers
NEVER skip dispatch mode - MANDATORY
NEVER split into multiple prompts
```

**Phase Output:**
- `spec_path` | `detection_method` | `error_message` | `affected_files`
- `execution_mode` | `dispatch_mode`

---

## 2. GATE 3 CLARIFICATION

When debugging leads to file modifications (Step 5, Option A "Apply the fix"):
- Spec folder established in setup -> Gate 3 satisfied
- Ad-hoc mode -> Ask before applying: Spec Folder: A) Existing | B) New | C) Update related | D) Skip

**Self-Verification:** Before applying any fix:
> STOP. File modification detected? Did I ask spec folder question? If NO -> Ask NOW.

---

## 3. PHASE STATUS VERIFICATION (BLOCKING)

| FIELD            | REQUIRED      | SOURCE                     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| spec_path        | Conditional   | Q0 or auto-detect or $ARGS |
| detection_method | Yes           | Auto-determined            |
| error_message    | Yes           | Q1 or conversation scan    |
| execution_mode   | Yes           | Suffix or Q2               |
| dispatch_mode    | Yes           | Q3                         |

All required fields set? YES -> Proceed to workflow. NO -> Re-prompt for missing values.

---

## 4. WORKFLOW STEPS (5 STEPS)

**Execute steps IN ORDER. Mark each ONLY after completing ALL activities. DO NOT SKIP.**

| STEP | NAME               | STATUS | REQUIRED OUTPUT      | VERIFICATION                    |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1    | Validate Context   |        | context_confirmed    | Spec path + error context valid |
| 2    | Generate Report    |        | debug-delegation.md  | File created in spec folder     |
| 3    | Dispatch Sub-Agent |        | sub_agent_dispatched | Task tool invoked               |
| 4    | Receive Findings   |        | findings_received    | Sub-agent response captured     |
| 5    | Integration        |        | resolution_complete  | User chose action, applied      |

# /spec_kit:debug

Delegate persistent debugging issues to a specialized sub-agent with fresh context. Creates a comprehensive debug report, dispatches a sub-agent, and integrates findings back into the main session.

```yaml
role: Expert Developer using Debug Delegation for Persistent Issues
purpose: Hand off debugging to fresh sub-agent with complete context handoff
action: Run 5-step debug workflow from context gathering through integration

operating_mode:
  workflow: sequential_5_step
  workflow_compliance: MANDATORY
  workflow_execution: sub_agent_delegation
  approvals: none
  tracking: debug_report_creation
  validation: sub_agent_response_check
```

**When to use:** Same error persists after 3+ attempts, need fresh perspective, want to preserve debugging context, primary agent stuck in loop.

---

## 5. CONTRACT

**Inputs:** `$ARGUMENTS` -- Optional spec folder path
**Outputs:** Debug resolution + `STATUS=<RESOLVED|NEEDS_REVIEW|ESCALATE>`

| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1    | Validate Context   | Confirm all inputs ready            | context_confirmed   |

## 7. INSTRUCTIONS

After all phases pass, load and execute the appropriate YAML prompt:

- **AUTONOMOUS**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_debug_auto.yaml`
- **INTERACTIVE**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_debug_confirm.yaml`

The YAML contains detailed step-by-step workflow, sub-agent prompt template, error handling, and all configuration.

## 10. EXAMPLES

```
/spec_kit:debug                                          # Auto-detect + conversation error
/spec_kit:debug specs/007-feature-name/004-implementation/  # Specific spec folder
```

After multiple failed attempts: Creates comprehensive delegation report with all attempts documented.

## 11. RELATED COMMANDS

| Command              | Relationship                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/spec_kit:complete` | Start feature work (debug when issues arise)    |
| `/spec_kit:handover` | Create handover (debug documents issue context) |
| `/spec_kit:resume`   | Resume work (may need debug after resuming)     |

---

## 12. INTEGRATION

### Debug Agent

Agent file: `.opencode/agent/debug.md`
- 4-phase methodology: Observe -> Analyze -> Hypothesize -> Fix
- Codebase-agnostic, isolation by design, structured responses

### Response Types

| Response       | Meaning                       | Next Action                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Success**    | Root cause found, fix applied | Verify fix, continue work  |
| **Blocked**    | Missing info or access issue  | Provide requested info     |
| **Escalation** | 3+ hypotheses failed          | Manual review or retry     |

### Memory Integration

After resolution:
- Run: `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js [spec-folder-path]`
- Consider `/memory:save` and `/memory:learn` to capture debugging insights
- debug-delegation.md serves as memory for the spec folder

---

## 13. COMMAND CHAIN

```
[/spec_kit:implement] -> /spec_kit:debug -> [Return to original workflow]
[/spec_kit:complete]  -> /spec_kit:debug -> [Return to original workflow]
```

After resolution: Return to the original workflow step that triggered debugging.
