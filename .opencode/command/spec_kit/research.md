---

> ⚠️ **EXECUTION PROTOCOL — READ FIRST**
>
> This command runs a structured YAML workflow. Do NOT dispatch agents from this document.
>
> **YOUR FIRST ACTION:**
> 1. Determine execution mode from user input (`:auto` or `:confirm`)
> 2. Load the corresponding YAML file from `assets/`:
>    - Auto mode → `spec_kit_research_auto.yaml`
>    - Confirm mode → `spec_kit_research_confirm.yaml`
> 3. Execute the YAML workflow step by step
>
> All content below is reference context for the YAML workflow. Do not treat reference sections, routing tables, or dispatch templates as direct instructions to execute.

## CONSTRAINTS

- **DO NOT** dispatch any agent (`@research`, `@context`, `@handover`) from this document
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@handover` unless the user explicitly requests it at the final step (Step 9)
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@research` from this document — the YAML workflow handles dispatch
- **ALL** agent dispatching is handled by the YAML workflow steps — this document is setup + reference only
- **FIRST ACTION** is always: load the YAML file, then execute it step by step

# SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT - ONE USER INTERACTION

This workflow gathers ALL inputs in ONE prompt. Round-trip: 1 user interaction.

---

## 0. UNIFIED SETUP PHASE

**FIRST MESSAGE PROTOCOL**: This prompt MUST be your FIRST response. No analysis, no tool calls — ask ALL questions immediately, then wait.

**STATUS: BLOCKED**

```
EXECUTE THIS SINGLE CONSOLIDATED PROMPT:

1. CHECK mode suffix:
   ├─ ":auto"    → execution_mode = "AUTONOMOUS" (omit Q2)
   ├─ ":confirm" → execution_mode = "INTERACTIVE" (omit Q2)
   └─ No suffix  → execution_mode = "ASK" (include Q2)

2. CHECK $ARGUMENTS for research topic:
   ├─ Has content (ignoring :auto/:confirm) → research_topic = $ARGUMENTS, omit Q0
   └─ Empty → include Q0

3. Search for related spec folders:
   $ ls -d specs/*/ 2>/dev/null | tail -10

4. Search for prior work (background):
   - memory_context({ input: research_topic OR "research", mode: "focused", includeContent: true })
   - Store: prior_work_found = [yes/no], prior_work_count = [N]

5. ASK with SINGLE prompt (include only applicable questions):

   Q0. Research Topic (if not in command): What topic to research?

   Q1. Spec Folder (required):
     A) Use existing [suggest if found]  B) Create new: specs/[###]-[slug]/
     C) Update related [if match found]  D) Skip documentation

   Q2. Execution Mode (if no suffix):
     A) Autonomous - all 9 steps without approval
     B) Interactive - pause at each step

   Q3. Dispatch Mode (required):
     A) Single Agent (Recommended)  B) Multi-Agent (1+2)  C) Multi-Agent (1+3)

   Reply format: "B, A, A" or "WebSocket research, B, A, A"

6. WAIT for user response (DO NOT PROCEED)

7. Parse response and store ALL results:
   - research_topic = [from Q0 or $ARGUMENTS]
   - spec_choice = [A/B/C/D from Q1]
   - spec_path = [derived path or null if D]
   - execution_mode = [AUTONOMOUS/INTERACTIVE from suffix or Q2]
   - dispatch_mode = [single/multi_small/multi_large from Q3]

8. SET STATUS: PASSED

STOP HERE - Wait for user answers before continuing.

⛔ DO NOT proceed until user explicitly answers
⛔ NEVER auto-create spec folders without confirmation
⛔ NEVER auto-select execution mode without suffix or choice
⛔ NEVER split questions into multiple prompts
```

**Phase Output:**
- `research_topic` | `spec_choice` | `spec_path`
- `execution_mode` | `dispatch_mode`

> **Cross-reference**: Implements AGENTS.md Section 2 "Gate 3: Spec Folder Question" and "First Message Protocol".

---

## 5. INSTRUCTIONS

After setup phase passes, load and execute the appropriate YAML prompt:
- **AUTONOMOUS**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_research_auto.yaml`
- **INTERACTIVE**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_research_confirm.yaml`

The YAML contains detailed step-by-step workflow, field extraction rules, completion report format, and all configuration.

---

## 6. OUTPUT FORMATS

**Success:**
```
All 9 research steps executed successfully.
Artifacts: research.md (17 sections), memory/*.md
Ready for: /spec_kit:plan [feature-description]
STATUS=OK PATH=[spec-folder-path]
```

**Failure:**
```
Error: [error description]  Step: [step number]
STATUS=FAIL ERROR="[message]"
```

---

## 7. PARALLEL DISPATCH

### Complexity Scoring (5 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Domain Count | 35% | 1=0.0, 2=0.5, 3+=1.0 |
| File Count | 25% | 1-2=0.0, 3-5=0.5, 6+=1.0 |
| LOC Estimate | 15% | <50=0.0, 50-200=0.5, >200=1.0 |
| Parallel Opportunity | 20% | sequential=0.0, some=0.5, high=1.0 |
| Task Type | 5% | trivial=0.0, moderate=0.5, complex=1.0 |

**Thresholds:** <20% proceed directly. >=20% + 2 domains: ALWAYS ask user.

### Eligible Phases

- `step_3_codebase_investigation` - Pattern exploration and architecture analysis (routed via `@context`)
- `step_4_external_research` - Documentation and best practices research
- `step_5_technical_analysis` - Feasibility and risk assessment

### User Override Phrases

- `"proceed directly"` / `"handle directly"` -> Skip parallel dispatch
- `"use parallel"` / `"dispatch agents"` -> Force parallel dispatch
- `"auto-decide"` -> Enable session auto-mode (1 hour)

### Workstream Prefix

Format: `[W:R-{sequence}]` where sequence is a 3-digit number (001, 002, etc.)

---

## 8. MEMORY INTEGRATION

### Before Starting Research

1. **UNIFIED CONTEXT RETRIEVAL** (primary): `memory_context({ input: research_topic, intent: "understand", includeContent: true })` -> Returns intent-aware context with relevance scoring
2. **FALLBACK** (fine-grained): `memory_search({ query: research_topic, intent: 'understand', anchors: ['research', 'findings', 'decisions'], includeConstitutional: true })`
3. **LOAD CONTEXT:** If matches found with similarity > 70: display summary, ask "Build on this or start fresh?". If constitutional memories found: always load.

### After Completing Research

1. **GENERATE:** `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js [spec-folder]`
2. **ANCHOR TAGGING** (automatic): `ANCHOR:research-[topic]`, `ANCHOR:findings`, `ANCHOR:recommendations`, `ANCHOR:decisions`
3. **VERIFY:** Check memory/*.md file created with proper anchors

### Memory Search by Phase

| Phase | Query | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Before Step 1 | `memory_context({ input: "topic", intent: "understand" })` | Prior related research |
| During Step 3 | `memory_search({ intent: 'understand', anchors: ['architecture'] })` | Existing patterns |
| During Step 5 | `memory_context({ input: "Why did we choose X over Y?" })` | Prior decisions |
| After Step 9 | `generate-context.js [spec-folder]` | Preserve current research |

---

## 9. QUALITY GATES

| Gate | Location | Purpose | Threshold |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Pre-execution | Before Step 1 | Validate inputs/prerequisites | >= 70 |
| Mid-execution | After Step 5 | Verify research progress/quality | >= 70 |
| Post-execution | After Step 9 | Confirm all deliverables | >= 70 |

Score >= 70 = PASS (proceed). Score < 70 = FAIL (block, require remediation).

**Pre-execution:** Research topic clearly defined, spec folder path valid, no blocking dependencies, execution mode established.

**Mid-execution:** Steps 1-5 completed with outputs, technical analysis has verifiable findings, no unresolved critical blockers, confidence >= 40%.

**Post-execution:** research.md exists with all 17 sections, key questions answered, quality checklist verified (L2+), context saved to memory/.

---

## 10. ERROR HANDLING

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `tool_timeout` | Retry once, then skip with note |
| `tool_error` | Log error, try alternate source |
| `validation_failure` | Flag conflicting evidence with sources |
| `agent_dispatch_failure` | Fall back to general agent with warning |
| `memory_operation_failure` | Save to scratch/ as backup |
| 3+ consecutive failures | Halt: Retry / Skip / Abort / Debug |

---

## 11. KEY DIFFERENCES

- **Does NOT proceed to implementation** - Terminates after research.md
- **Primary output is research.md** - Comprehensive technical documentation
- **Use case** - Technical uncertainty, feasibility analysis, documentation
- **Next steps** - Feeds into `/spec_kit:plan` or `/spec_kit:complete`

---

## 12. EXAMPLES

```
/spec_kit:research:auto "Webflow CMS integration with external payment gateway and email service"
/spec_kit:research:confirm "Real-time collaboration system with conflict resolution"
```

---

## 13. COMMAND CHAIN

`/spec_kit:research` -> `/spec_kit:plan` -> `/spec_kit:implement`

**Explicit next step:** `/spec_kit:plan [feature-description]`

---

## 14. NEXT STEPS

| Condition | Suggested Command | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Research complete, ready to plan | `/spec_kit:plan [feature-description]` | Use findings for spec/plan |
| Need more investigation | `/spec_kit:research [new-topic]` | Deeper dive on specific area |
| Research reveals blockers | Document in research.md | Capture constraints |
| Need to pause work | `/spec_kit:handover [spec-folder-path]` | Save context for later |
| Want to save context | `/memory:save [spec-folder-path]` | Preserve research findings |
