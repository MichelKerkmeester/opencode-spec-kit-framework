> ⚠️ **EXECUTION PROTOCOL — READ FIRST**
>
> This command runs a structured YAML workflow. Do NOT dispatch agents from this document.
>
> **YOUR FIRST ACTION:**
> 1. Determine execution mode from user input (`:auto`, `:confirm`, `:with-research`, `:auto-debug`)
> 2. Load the corresponding YAML file from `assets/`:
>    - Auto mode → `spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml`
>    - Confirm mode → `spec_kit_complete_confirm.yaml`
> 3. Execute the YAML workflow step by step
>
> All content below is reference context for the YAML workflow. Do not treat reference sections, routing tables, or dispatch templates as direct instructions to execute.

## CONSTRAINTS

- **DO NOT** dispatch any agent (`@review`, `@debug`, `@handover`, `@speckit`, `@context`, `@research`) from this document
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@review` to review this workflow or command prompt
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@handover` unless the user explicitly requests it at the final step (Step 14)
- **DO NOT** dispatch `@debug` unless `failure_count >= 3` during the Development step (Step 10)
- **ALL** agent dispatching is handled by the YAML workflow steps — this document is setup + reference only
- **FIRST ACTION** is always: load the YAML file, then execute it step by step

---

## 4. PHASE A: PLANNING (Steps 1-7)

| STEP | NAME | REQUIRED OUTPUT | VERIFICATION |
|------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | Request Analysis | requirement_summary | Scope defined |
| 2 | Pre-Work Review | coding_standards_summary | AGENTS.md reviewed |
| 3 | Specification | `spec.md` created | File exists, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] |
| 4 | Clarification | updated `spec.md` | Ambiguities resolved |
| 5 | Quality Checklist | `checklist.md` (Level 2+) | Checklist items defined |
| 6 | Planning | `plan.md` (+ research.md if Phase 3 ran) | Technical approach documented |
| 7 | Task Breakdown | `tasks.md` created | All tasks listed with IDs |

### Planning Gate (HARD BLOCK between Step 7 and Step 8)

All planning artifacts must exist before implementation begins. Score >= 70 to pass:
- spec.md exists with NO [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (25 pts)
- plan.md exists with technical approach defined (25 pts)
- tasks.md exists with all tasks listed as T### IDs (25 pts)
- checklist.md verified - Level 2+ (15 pts)
- the review agent's approval (10 pts)

IF any artifact missing -> STOP -> Return to appropriate step -> Complete -> Re-attempt gate

### Optional Research Phase

When `:with-research` flag present or research_triggered == TRUE:
- Execute 9-step research workflow using same spec_path and execution_mode
- Display checkpoint with key findings summary
- User responds: Y (continue) / n (pause) / review (see research.md first)
- If research_triggered == FALSE, skip directly to workflow execution

---

## 5. PHASE B: IMPLEMENTATION (Steps 8-14)

| STEP | NAME | REQUIRED OUTPUT | VERIFICATION |
|------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 8 | Analysis | consistency_report | Artifacts cross-checked |
| 9 | Implementation Check | prerequisites_verified | Ready to implement |
| 9.5 | **PREFLIGHT Capture** | preflight_baseline | Epistemic baseline recorded |
| 10 | Development | code changes + tasks marked `[x]` | **ALL tasks in tasks.md marked complete** |
| 11 | Checklist Verify | All P0/P1 verified | **Level 2+ ONLY - BLOCKING** |
| 11.5 | **POSTFLIGHT Capture** | postflight_delta | Learning delta calculated |
| 12 | Completion | `implementation-summary.md` | **Summary file created (MANDATORY Level 1+)** |
| 13 | Save Context | `memory/*.md` | Context preserved |
| 14 | Handover Check | User prompted | Handover offered before completion |

### Step Requirements

**Step 9.5 (PREFLIGHT):** Execute after Step 9, before Step 10. Skip if: quick fix (<10 LOC) or continuation with existing PREFLIGHT. Call `task_preflight()` with: specFolder, taskId, knowledgeScore, uncertaintyScore, contextScore, knowledgeGaps. User can say "skip preflight".

**Step 10 (Development):** Load tasks.md, execute in order. Mark each task `[x]` when completed. MUST NOT claim "development complete" until ALL tasks marked `[x]`. Test code changes before marking complete.

**Step 10 - Scope Growth / Level Upgrade:** If scope grows during Step 10, run `upgrade-level.sh` to add higher-level templates. After the script completes, the AI agent **must** auto-populate all injected `[placeholder]` text:
1. Read all existing spec files (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, implementation-summary.md) for context
2. Identify all `[placeholder]` patterns in newly injected template sections
3. Replace each placeholder with content derived from existing spec context
4. Run `check-placeholders.sh` on the spec folder to verify zero placeholders remain
If source context is insufficient for a section, write "N/A - insufficient source context" rather than leaving placeholders or fabricating content.

**Step 11 (Checklist Verification - Level 2+ BLOCKING):** Load checklist.md. Verify ALL P0 items marked `[x]` with evidence. P1: marked `[x]` with evidence OR documented user approval to defer. P2: may defer without approval. Evidence format: `[EVIDENCE: file.js:45-67 - implementation verified]`. HARD BLOCK: Cannot proceed to Step 12 if any P0 items unchecked.

**Step 11.5 (POSTFLIGHT):** Execute after Step 11, before Step 12. Skip if: quick fix (<10 LOC) or no PREFLIGHT at Step 9.5. Call `task_postflight()` with: specFolder, taskId, knowledgeScore, uncertaintyScore, contextScore, gapsClosed, newGapsDiscovered. Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta x 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction x 0.35) + (Context Improvement x 0.25).

**Step 12 (Completion - MANDATORY Level 1+):** Validation runs automatically (exit 0=pass, 1=warnings, 2=errors must fix). Verify all tasks show `[x]`. Create implementation-summary.md with: files modified/created, verification steps, deviations from plan, testing results.

**Step 13 (Save Context):** Use `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js [spec-folder-path]`. DO NOT use Write/Edit tools to create memory files directly.

**Step 14 (Session Handover Check):** Display handover prompt offering `/spec_kit:handover`. Recommended if: continuing later, another dev may pick up, implementation has nuances. Wait for user response before marking workflow complete.

---

## 6. STEP 10 DEBUG INTEGRATION

Track failure_count per task during Step 10 (reset for each task in tasks.md):

IF failure_count >= 3:
- IF `:auto-debug` flag -> AUTO dispatch debug sub-agent
- ELSE -> Suggest: A) Dispatch debug agent B) Continue manually (reset count) C) Skip task D) Pause workflow

IF debug triggered: Store current_task_id, execute debug workflow (5 steps) via Task tool, display checkpoint (root cause, fix status, progress). User responds: Y (retry) / n (pause) / review (debug findings).

---

## 7. INSTRUCTIONS

After setup phase passes, load and execute the appropriate YAML prompt:
- **AUTONOMOUS**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml`
- **INTERACTIVE**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_complete_confirm.yaml`

The YAML contains detailed step-by-step workflow, field extraction rules, completion report format, and all configuration.

---

## 8. OUTPUT FORMATS

**Success:**
```
All 14 steps executed successfully.
Artifacts: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, implementation-summary.md, memory/*.md
STATUS=OK PATH=[spec-folder-path]
```

**Failure:**
```
Error: [error description]  Step: [step number]
STATUS=FAIL ERROR="[message]"
```

---

## 9. VALIDATION

Validation runs automatically on the spec folder before marking complete.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | JSON format output |
| `--strict` | Treat warnings as errors |
| `--quiet` | Suppress output except errors |
| `--verbose` | Detailed output with timing |

**7 Rules:** FILE_EXISTS, PLACEHOLDER_FILLED, SECTIONS_PRESENT, LEVEL_DECLARED, PRIORITY_TAGS, EVIDENCE_CITED, ANCHORS_VALID

**Exit codes:** 0 = pass, 1 = warnings, 2 = errors (must fix)

---

## 10. PARALLEL DISPATCH

### Complexity Scoring (5 Dimensions)

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Domain Count | 35% | 1=0.0, 2=0.5, 3+=1.0 |
| File Count | 25% | 1-2=0.0, 3-5=0.5, 6+=1.0 |
| LOC Estimate | 15% | <50=0.0, 50-200=0.5, >200=1.0 |
| Parallel Opportunity | 20% | sequential=0.0, some=0.5, high=1.0 |
| Task Type | 5% | trivial=0.0, moderate=0.5, complex=1.0 |

**Thresholds:** <20% proceed directly. >=20% + 2 domains: ALWAYS ask user.

### Step 6: 4-Agent Parallel Exploration (Automatic)

Dispatches 4 `@context` agents (`subagent_type: "context"`) via Task tool. Per AGENTS.md, `@context` is the **exclusive** agent for all codebase exploration.

1. **Architecture Explorer** - Structure, entry points, component connections
2. **Feature Explorer** - Similar features, related patterns
3. **Dependency Explorer** - Imports, modules, affected areas
4. **Test Explorer** - Test patterns, testing infrastructure

After agents return, hypotheses are verified by reading identified files.

### Eligible Phases

Steps 3 (Specification), 6 (Planning + auto 4-agent), 8 (Analysis), 10 (Development)

### Override Phrases

- **Direct**: "proceed directly", "handle directly", "skip parallel"
- **Parallel**: "use parallel", "dispatch agents", "parallelize"
- **Auto-decide**: "auto-decide", "auto mode" (1 hour session preference)

### Workstream Prefixes

`[W:ARCH]` Architecture | `[W:FEAT]` Feature | `[W:DEPS]` Dependency | `[W:TEST]` Test | `[W:IMPL-N]` Implementation workstream N

## 11. QUALITY GATES

| Gate | Location | Purpose | Threshold | Blocking |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Pre-execution | Before Step 1 | Validate inputs/prerequisites | >= 70 | **HARD** |
| Planning Gate | Between Step 7-8 | Verify planning artifacts | >= 70 | **HARD** |
| Post-execution | After Step 12 | Verify all deliverables | >= 70 | Hard |

### Five Checks Framework (Level 3+ specs)

Required at Planning Gate for Level 3/3+ (optional Level 2). Record in decision-record.md.

| # | Check | Question | Pass Criteria |
|---|-------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Necessary? | Solving ACTUAL need NOW? | Clear requirement, not speculative |
| 2 | Beyond Local Max? | Explored alternatives? | >=2 alternatives with trade-offs |
| 3 | Sufficient? | Simplest approach? | No simpler solution achieves goal |
| 4 | Fits Goal? | On critical path? | Directly advances stated objective |
| 5 | Open Horizons? | Long-term aligned? | No tech debt or lock-in |

### Gate Scoring

**Pre-execution (>= 70):** feature_description not empty (30), spec_path valid (30), execution_mode set (20), memory context loaded (20)

**Planning Gate (>= 70):** spec.md no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] (25), plan.md with approach (25), tasks.md with T### IDs (25), checklist.md verified L2+ (15), the review agent's approval (10)

**Post-execution (>= 70):** All tasks marked [x] (30), implementation-summary.md exists (40), memory/*.md saved (20), validation passed (10)

---

## 12. ERROR HANDLING

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Missing feature description | Re-prompt user |
| Planning gate fails (<70) | Return to incomplete step, complete it |
| 3+ implementation failures | :auto-debug -> debug agent; else suggest to user |
| Review agent P0 FAIL | BLOCK completion; user must fix |
| Agent unavailable | Fall back to `general` with warning |
| Validation errors (exit 2) | Fix before proceeding |
| Incomplete session detected | Offer: Resume / Restart / Cancel |
