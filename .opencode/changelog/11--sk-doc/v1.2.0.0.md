## [**1.2.0.0**] - 2026-02-28

**Install guide standards aligned with 11-section template** — Updated `install_guide_standards.md` and `quick_reference.md` to match the 0-10 section structure defined in `install_guide_template.md`. Restructured all 4 SET-UP guides in `.opencode/install_guides/` to follow the same template. Deleted the standalone `TEMPLATE - Install Guide.md` (now superseded by the sk-doc template).

> Spec folder: N/A (reference alignment, no spec folder required)

## Highlights

### Reference Updates

- **`install_guide_standards.md`**: Replaced old 7-row "Required Sections" table with full 11-section (0-10) table. Added Core Principle blockquote requirement, STOP block requirement (5+ per guide), and updated pre-publish checklist
- **`quick_reference.md`**: Updated section 10 table from 1-10 numbering to 0-10 numbering with Required column and key requirements note

### SET-UP Guide Restructuring (4 guides)

- **SET-UP - AGENTS.md**: Restructured to 11-section format with AI-First prompt, Core Principle blockquote, validation checkpoints, and STOP blocks
- **SET-UP - Opencode Agents.md**: Restructured to 11-section format with full phase validation
- **SET-UP - Skill Advisor.md** (in README.md): Updated to point to sk-doc template as source of truth
- **SET-UP - Skill Creation.md**: Restructured to 11-section format with full phase validation

### Template Cleanup

- **Deleted `TEMPLATE - Install Guide.md`**: Removed from `install_guides/` directory. The sk-doc template (`assets/documentation/install_guide_template.md`) is now the single source of truth
- **Updated `README.md`**: Now points to the sk-doc template instead of the deleted standalone template

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/sk-doc/references/install_guide_standards.md` (updated)
- `.opencode/skill/sk-doc/references/quick_reference.md` (updated)
- `.opencode/install_guides/SET-UP - AGENTS.md` (restructured)
- `.opencode/install_guides/SET-UP - Opencode Agents.md` (restructured)
- `.opencode/install_guides/SET-UP - Skill Creation.md` (restructured)
- `.opencode/install_guides/README.md` (updated)
- `.opencode/install_guides/TEMPLATE - Install Guide.md` (deleted)

## Upgrade

No migration required. The install guide template in `assets/documentation/install_guide_template.md` was already correct and unchanged. Reference files and SET-UP guides now match its 11-section structure.
