## [**1.1.2.0**] - 2026-02-24

**Canonical `sk-doc` namespace migration documented** - Added release coverage for repo-wide canonical rename closure that standardized documentation-skill naming and namespace references with full verification evidence.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/` (Level 2)

## Highlights

### Namespace and Identity

- **Canonical alias closure recorded**: Repository references now converge on canonical `sk-doc` naming.
- **Namespace consistency captured**: Skill path, runtime symlink naming, and changelog namespace migration evidence are documented in one closure run.

### Verification

- **Remnant policy checks recorded as clean**: Final remnant-count evidence reports zero for tracked legacy identifier families.
- **Execution parity verified**: Path-rename map/log parity and strict completion checks are documented as passing.

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/{spec.md,plan.md,tasks.md,checklist.md,implementation-summary.md}`

## Upgrade

No migration required. Pull latest to align with canonical `sk-doc` naming and documentation references.
