## [**1.1.0.0**] - 2026-02-24

**`sk-code--opencode` policy refinement synchronized with Level 3+ evidence** - Updated standards language to keep inline-comment guidance concise and AI-parse-friendly while preserving structural non-regression expectations.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/043-sk-code-opencode-refinement/` (Level 3+)

## Highlights

### Policy and Structure

- **Inline-comment policy tightened**: Guidance now emphasizes rationale and risk context over narrative or mechanical comments.
- **Structure conventions preserved**: Numbered ALL-CAPS section conventions remain explicitly protected as non-regression constraints.
- **Verification-backed closure**: Release mapping follows the spec evidence run that closed with scope-audit pass and documented warning-only validation.

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md`

## Upgrade

No migration required. Pull latest to apply the refined standards contract.
