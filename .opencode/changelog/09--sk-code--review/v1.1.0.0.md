## [**1.1.0.0**] - 2026-02-22

**Initial release of `sk-code--review` baseline skill** - Added a stack-agnostic review baseline with findings-first severity analysis, baseline plus overlay precedence, and runtime integration across review dispatch surfaces.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/041-code-review-skill/` (Level 2)

## Highlights

### New Review Baseline Skill

- Added `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/` as a first-class review baseline package.
- Introduced mandatory security and correctness minimums with findings-first reporting.
- Added structured review references for security, code quality, SOLID checks, and safe removal planning.

### Baseline + Overlay Contract

- Standardized review flow to baseline first, then exactly one stack overlay.
- Added precedence rules so overlay style and process guidance can specialize behavior while baseline risk minimums remain mandatory.
- Added unknown fallback checklist for ambiguous stack or scope detection.

### Runtime and Routing Integration

- Integrated review baseline contract into review and orchestration playbooks across runtime profiles.
- Updated skill routing behavior so review intent maps to `sk-code--review` while preserving existing git and visual-review routing paths.
