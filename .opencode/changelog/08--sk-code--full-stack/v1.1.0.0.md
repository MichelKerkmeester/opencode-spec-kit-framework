**Routing model alignment and structure merge** - Realigned full-stack orchestration to the current Smart Routing model and merged duplicated mapping content into unified resource domains.

## Highlights

### Smart Routing

- Standardized routing section order around detection-first flow and one authoritative `Smart Router Pseudocode` block.
- Merged stack-to-domain mapping into `Resource Domains` to remove duplicate routing definitions.
- Kept stack-specific verification guidance explicit for lower ambiguity during intent routing.

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/sk-code--full-stack/SKILL.md`
