## [**1.0.0.0**] - 2026-02-17

**Orchestrate.md restructure: 27 sections to 10 sections** -- Full reorganization of all three orchestrate.md variants (base, chatgpt, copilot) around the orchestrator's actual decision loop. Eliminates bloat, consolidates scattered budget sections, promotes copilot-unique improvements to all variants, and adds semantic emoji alignment.

## Highlights

### Structural Restructure (27 to 10 sections)

- **Reorganized around decision loop** -- Sections now follow: receive, route, dispatch, enforce, evaluate, handle-failure, synthesize, deliver.
- **NDP promoted from buried section 26 to section 2** -- Nesting Depth Protocol is now immediately after Core Workflow for high visibility.
- **Budget consolidation** -- CWB, TCB, and resource budgeting merged from 3 scattered locations into single section 8.
- **Anti-patterns condensed 12 to 6** -- Removed items that merely restated existing rules.

### Aspirational Sections Removed

- **6 sections with no runtime backing removed** -- Event-Driven Triggers, Saga Compensation, Caching Layer, Incremental Checkpointing, Summary, Mermaid Visualization.
- **Net reduction** -- ~900 lines to ~780 lines per file (13% reduction with content additions).

### Cross-Variant Improvements

- **Copilot Rule 2 expansion promoted** -- Spec folder verification gates (pre-dispatch, dispatch validation, post-creation verification) now in all variants.
- **Copilot Rule 6 promoted** -- Routing violation detection (wrong agent, template bypass, level not determined, no validation) now in all variants.
- **Skill references unified** -- `workflows-code--web-dev` / `workflows-code--full-stack` replaced with `workflows-code--*` wildcard pattern for auto-detection.

### Semantic Emoji Alignment

- **7 semantic emojis added** -- Aligned with context.md and workflows-documentation conventions.
- **Emoji vocabulary** -- `✅` Legal, `❌` Illegal/Rejection, `🔒` Mandatory/Locked enforcement.
- **No decorative emojis** -- H2 section headers remain plain; emojis only on H3/H4 subsections where they aid scanning.
