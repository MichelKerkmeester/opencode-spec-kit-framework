## [**1.0.9.0**] - 2026-02-20

**HVR integration and file relocation** - Rewrote `hvr_rules.md` as a proper skill reference document, moved it from `assets/documentation/` to `references/`, updated all path references across both skills, and fixed the outdated file tree in `quick_reference.md`.

## Highlights

### Added

- **HVR references in install_guide_template.md** - Added HVR link to Writing Style section (line 436) and "HVR compliance verified" checkbox to Install Guide Checklist (line 479).
- **HVR intent signal in SKILL.md** - Added `"HVR"` to INTENT_SIGNALS with weight 4 and keywords `["human voice", "hvr", "voice rules", "banned words", "writing style"]`.
- **HVR resource mapping** - Added `"HVR": ["references/hvr_rules.md"]` to RESOURCE_MAP and updated DQI compliance text.

### Changed

- **hvr_rules.md rewritten** - Converted from 778-line AI-system-document format to 331-line skill reference format following `skill_asset_template.md` standards. Standard frontmatter, ANCHOR tags, numbered H2 sections, RELATED RESOURCES as last section.
- **hvr_rules.md relocated** - Moved from `assets/documentation/` to `references/`. The file is loaded into agent context (reference), not used as output template (asset). All path references updated across SKILL.md (3 lines), install_guide_template.md (1 line), readme_template.md (2 lines), and hvr_rules.md internal links (2 lines).
- **quick_reference.md file tree fixed** - Section 7 tree was outdated. Replaced with correct on-disk structure showing `documentation/` and `opencode/` subdirectories, and added 10 missing files (`hvr_rules.md`, `validate_document.py`, `validate_flowchart.sh`, `readme_template.md`, `install_guide_template.md`, `agent_template.md`, `skill_asset_template.md`, `skill_reference_template.md`, `template_rules.json`, `install_guide_standards.md`).
- **SKILL.md version** bumped from `1.0.8.0` to `1.0.9.0`.

### Audit

- **References audit** - All 7 reference files checked: 0/7 mention HVR (noted as future gap), no broken paths after relocation.
- **Scripts audit** - All 6 scripts + test suite confirmed UP TO DATE. No scripts reference `hvr_rules.md`, so the move has zero script impact.
- **Create commands audit** - All 8 YAML workflow files checked. No references to `hvr_rules.md`. All `assets/documentation/` paths point to files that still exist there.

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/references/hvr_rules.md` (moved from `assets/documentation/`)
- `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/SKILL.md`
- `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/documentation/install_guide_template.md`
- `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/assets/documentation/readme_template.md`
- `.opencode/skill/workflows-documentation/references/quick_reference.md`

## Upgrade

No action required. Pull latest. The `hvr_rules.md` path changed from `assets/documentation/` to `references/`. Any custom references to the old path need updating.
