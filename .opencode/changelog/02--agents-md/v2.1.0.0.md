## [**2.1.0.0**] - 2026-02-24

**AGENTS.md structural overhaul — condensed formatting, skill references, section consolidation** — Replaced verbose ASCII box art gates with structured markdown, merged Consolidated Question Protocol into gates section, condensed Documentation/Confidence/Analysis sections to reference system-spec-kit SKILL.md, converted Agent Definitions from table to bullet list, removed @speckit Exclusivity block (lives in skill), and renumbered from 9 to 8 sections. Created anonymized AGENTS_FULL_STACK.md variant based on sk-code--full-stack and sk-git skills.

---

## Highlights

### Category: Structural Refactoring

- **ASCII box gates → markdown**: Replaced ~148 lines of code-block box art (Pre-Execution + Post-Execution gates) with structured `####` headers, bullet lists, blockquotes, and checkboxes (~55 lines)
- **§3 Consolidated Question Protocol merged into §2 Gates**: Question protocol is gate behavior, now lives as `#### CONSOLIDATED QUESTION PROTOCOL` under Gate 3
- **Sections renumbered 1-8** (was 1-9): All internal cross-references updated (e.g., `see §5` → `see §4`)

### Category: Content Condensation

- **§4 Documentation (was §4)**: Removed duplicated Spec Folder Structure table, Sub-Folder Versioning, Dynamic State, Scratch vs Memory — replaced with single reference to system-spec-kit SKILL.md §3. Kept Documentation Levels table as quick-reference
- **§4 Confidence (was §5)**: Thresholds from inline text → scannable table. Removed clarification question format example
- **§5 Analysis (was §6)**: Solution Flow ASCII art → inline arrow chain. Pre-Change Checklist code block → checkbox markdown. Five Checks table → inline
- **`implementation-summary.md` note**: Made explicit with bold emphasis and cross-reference to SKILL.md §4 Rule 13

### Category: Formatting Improvements

- **Agent Definitions**: Table → bullet list format for better readability of long `@speckit` exclusivity description
- **@speckit Exclusivity Enforcement (T020)**: Removed from §2 — already documented in system-spec-kit SKILL.md §1 and `@speckit` agent definition in §6

### Category: New File

- **`AGENTS_FULL_STACK.md` created**: Anonymized full-stack variant (no project-specific branding) based on:
  - `sk-code--full-stack` SKILL.md: Stack detection table (Go, Swift, React Native, React/Next.js, Node.js), 3-phase lifecycle, verification commands
  - `sk-git` SKILL.md: Git workflow description (worktree, commit, finish sub-workflows)

## Files Changed

- `AGENTS.md` — Major restructure
- `CLAUDE.md` — Synced with AGENTS.md changes (auto-sync)
- `AGENTS_FULL_STACK.md` — Created (anonymized from Barter template)

**Total: 2 files modified, 1 file created**

## Line Count Impact

| Section | Before | After | Reduction |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| §2 Gates (pre+post) | ~148 lines | ~55 lines | -63% |
| §3 Question Protocol | ~39 lines | Merged into §2 | -100% |
| §4 Documentation | ~50 lines | ~20 lines | -60% |
| §4 Confidence (was §5) | ~26 lines | ~9 lines | -65% |
| §5 Analysis (was §6) | ~55 lines | ~13 lines | -76% |
| Agent Definitions | Table | Bullet list | Improved readability |

## Upgrade

No migration required. Behavioral rules are unchanged — only formatting and deduplication. All condensed content references system-spec-kit SKILL.md as the source of truth.
