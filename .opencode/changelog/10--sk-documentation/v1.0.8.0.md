## [**1.0.8.0**] - 2026-02-17

**Smart Routing standards alignment** - Updated sk-documentation template and creation standards to match current detection-first routing structure used across active skills.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/000-skills/002-smart-router-v2/`

---

## Highlights

### Documentation

- Updated `assets/opencode/skill_md_template.md` Section 2 guidance to use: primary detection signal, phase detection, merged resource domains/mapping, loading levels, and one authoritative `Smart Router Pseudocode` block.
- Updated `references/skill_creation.md` examples and standards to remove legacy routing patterns and align with the current Smart Routing structure.
- Replaced legacy "Resource Router" / "Activation Detection" template guidance with current terminology and structure.
- Updated resource organization standards so `references/` may be flat (small skills) or domain-subfoldered (medium/complex skills).
- Bumped `sk-documentation/SKILL.md` version to `1.0.8.0`.

### Validation

- Ran `extract_structure.py` successfully for:
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/assets/opencode/skill_md_template.md`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/references/skill_creation.md`

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/assets/opencode/skill_md_template.md`
- `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/references/skill_creation.md`
- `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/SKILL.md`
