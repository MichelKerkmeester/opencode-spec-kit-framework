## [**2.3.0.10**] - 2026-02-24

**Spec 139 Phase 007 template-policy enforcement documented** - Added release coverage for the docs-only policy pass that removed disallowed ToC blocks from targeted standard artifacts and captured validation outcomes.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/007-spec-kit-templates/` (Level 2)

## Highlights

### Category: Documentation Policy

- **Level 2 phase docs completed**: Phase 007 root artifacts were created and synchronized for policy-enforcement scope.
- **Targeted ToC cleanup recorded**: Disallowed ToC sections were removed from scoped standard artifacts in `039`, `040`, and `041`.

### Category: Validation and Limits

- **Policy scan passes captured**: Scoped ToC policy scan evidence is recorded as passing.
- **Validation outcomes recorded transparently**: `007` validation passed with warnings, while pre-existing validation debt in `039` and `040` remained explicitly documented as out of scope.
