## [**2.2.18.0**] - 2026-02-16

**AI auto-populate workflow for spec upgrades** — Spec 128 defines and integrates a mandatory post-upgrade AI workflow where the agent reads existing spec context and replaces all `[placeholder]` text injected by `upgrade-level.sh` with derived content.

> Spec folder: `specs/003-system-spec-kit/128-upgrade-auto-populate/` (Level 3+)

## Highlights

### Spec 128: AI Auto-Populate on Spec Upgrade (Workflow + Script)

- **Post-upgrade auto-populate workflow** — After `upgrade-level.sh` runs, the AI agent reads existing spec files, identifies `[placeholder]` patterns in newly injected sections, and replaces them with context-derived content
- **`check-placeholders.sh`** — New script that scans spec folder `.md` files for remaining bracket placeholder patterns (exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = fail). Supports `--json` and `--verbose` flags
- **`/spec_kit:complete` integration** — Step 10 scope-growth guidance now includes the full auto-populate procedure with 4-step workflow and `check-placeholders.sh` verification
- **SKILL.md expanded guidance** — Escalation section expanded with explicit auto-populate instructions, missing-context handling (N/A strategy), and cross-reference to `level_specifications.md`
- **ADR-001** — AI-side workflow chosen over script modification (shell cannot reason about content)
- **ADR-002** — Missing source context handled with "N/A" rather than fabrication
