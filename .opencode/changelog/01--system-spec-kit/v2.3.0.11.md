## [**2.3.0.11**] - 2026-02-24

**Spec 139 Phase 008 code-quality completion run documented** - Captured closure for baseline defect stabilization, moderate modularization, standards propagation checks, and full verification-matrix pass evidence.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/` (Level 3)

## Highlights

### Category: Quality Stabilization

- **Baseline triad closure recorded**: Graph-search contract, query-expansion behavior, and memory-save stability defects were stabilized and retained through reruns.
- **Moderate modularization completed**: `memory-index` maintainability gating was addressed via focused extraction without broad rewrite.
- **README and standards alignment captured**: Repo-owned README modernization and explicit standards-verifier guidance were included in closure artifacts.

### Category: Verification

- **Full matrix passes recorded**: Typecheck, full tests, scoped Vitest runs, lint, validation test suites, and phase-system tests are captured as passing.
- **Alignment drift checks recorded**: `verify_alignment_drift.py` is documented as passing with zero findings.
- **Phase continuity recorded**: Evidence and artifacts from phase `009` were merged into `008` continuity docs.

## Upgrade

No schema migration is documented for this phase. Pull latest and keep the existing verification sequence when running maintenance passes.
