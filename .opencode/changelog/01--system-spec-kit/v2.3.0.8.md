## [**2.3.0.8**] - 2026-02-24

**Spec 139 Phase 001 deprecation closure documented and consolidated** - Captured final evidence and consolidation artifacts for SGQS/readme-indexing/skill-ref deprecation closure, including verification results and active-folder merge governance.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/001-deprecated-skill-graph-experiment/` (Level 3)

---

## Highlights

### Category: Documentation Closure

- **Completion artifacts finalized**: Phase 001 now has complete Level 3 closure docs (`spec`, `plan`, `tasks`, `checklist`, `decision-record`, `implementation-summary`) plus a merge manifest.
- **Legacy consolidation captured**: Archived skill-graph-related legacy phase folders are mapped in one manifest with explicit active-state rules.

### Category: Verification

- **Build and regression evidence captured**: `npx tsc` and full MCP test suite runs are recorded as passing for the active closure pass.
- **Forbidden-term policy scans captured**: SGQS/readme-indexing/skill-ref scan evidence is documented as clean for active target surfaces.
- **Placeholder-scan nuance documented**: Generated memory section-label matches were recorded as expected non-template false positives.

## Upgrade

No migration required. This release documents closure and consolidation state; runtime behavior remains governed by previously shipped deprecation changes.
