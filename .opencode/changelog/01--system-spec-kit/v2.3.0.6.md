## [**2.3.0.6**] - 2026-02-22

**SpecKit Phase System implemented across routing, creation, and recursive validation (state-sync release)** - Phase-aware behavior is now integrated into recommendation, creation, command routing, and validation surfaces, with fixture-driven closure still pending for three verification tasks.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/138-spec-kit-phase-system/` (Level 3+)

## Highlights

### Category: Features

- **Phase recommendation added**: `recommend-level.sh` now supports phase scoring and recommendation outputs (`--recommend-phases`, `--phase-threshold`).
- **Phase creation workflow added**: `create.sh` now supports `--phase`, `--phases`, and `--phase-names` with parent/child linkage metadata.
- **Phase command path added**: `/spec_kit:phase` command and workflow assets were introduced for autonomous and confirm-style flows.
- **Recursive validation support added**: `validate.sh --recursive` and phase-link rule support were added for parent-child spec trees.

### Category: Documentation and Routing

- **Router integration landed**: SKILL routing maps now include PHASE intent/resource/command boosts.
- **Existing commands updated**: `/spec_kit:plan`, `/spec_kit:implement`, `/spec_kit:complete`, and `/spec_kit:resume` were updated for phase-aware behavior.
- **Reference corpus updated**: phase definitions, structure references, validation docs, node graph entry, and Gate 3 Option E documentation were synchronized.

### Category: Status

- **Implementation breadth completed**: `31/34` tasks are marked complete in spec evidence.
- **Open backlog remains**: fixture-oriented tasks `T005`, `T028`, and `T033` remain pending and keep full verification/sign-off open.

## Upgrade

Use phase-specific flags and recursive validation in phase-based workflows (`--recommend-phases`, `--phase`, `--recursive`). Functional behavior is available now, but fixture-driven closure and final governance sign-off remain pending for this spec.
