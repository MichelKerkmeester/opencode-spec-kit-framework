## [**2.2.28.0**] - 2026-02-20

**Clarify Skill Graph as Supplemental** -- Updated SKILL.md Graph Status header and index.md to explicitly frame the Skill Graph as a supplemental navigation layer, not a replacement for SKILL.md. Fixed replacement-implying language across all 8 spec documents in 002-skill-graph-integration.

> Spec folder: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/138-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-skill-graph-integration/` (Level 3+)

## Highlights

### SKILL.md Graph Status Header

- Replaced "running in graph mode" / "compatibility entrypoint" block with corrected supplemental framing
- SKILL.md explicitly labeled as **primary entrypoint** (activation rules, routing, core behavior)
- index.md labeled as **supplemental navigation** (optional deep-dive into specific topics)

### index.md Positioning Note

- Added navigation note: "This is a supplemental deep-dive index. SKILL.md remains the primary entrypoint"

### Spec Documentation (002-skill-graph-integration/)

- Fixed ~35 replacement-implying phrases across spec.md, decision-record.md, implementation-summary.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, handover.md, research.md
- Removed: "compatibility entrypoint", "during migration", "were monolithic", "decomposed into"
- Added: "primary entrypoint", "supplemental graph navigation", "Graph Status header"

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` -- Graph Status header
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/index.md` -- Navigation note
- 8 files in `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/138-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-skill-graph-integration/`

## Upgrade

No action required. Language-only changes with no behavioral impact.
