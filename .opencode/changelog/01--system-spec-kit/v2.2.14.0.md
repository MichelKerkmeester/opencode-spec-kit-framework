## [**2.2.14.0**] - 2026-02-15

**Fix subfolder path resolution in generate-context.js** — `path.isAbsolute()` was not handling relative subfolder paths correctly, causing failures with nested spec folder paths like `003-parent/121-child`. Consolidated path resolution logic to handle both absolute and relative inputs.
