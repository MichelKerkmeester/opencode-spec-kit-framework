## [**1.0.2.8**] - 2026-01-02

**Asset Reorganization** — Restructures workflows-documentation skill folders for improved discoverability with 250+ path reference updates.

---

## Highlights

### Asset Folder Reorganization

- **Renamed structure**: `assets/components/` → `assets/opencode/` (OpenCode component templates), `assets/documents/` → `assets/documentation/` (document templates)
- **250+ path references updated** across: `SKILL.md` · 7 reference files · 9 asset files · `AGENTS.md` · `write.md` agent · 7 command files · 2 install guides
- **New organizational principle** established and documented:
  - `references/` = FLAT (no subfolders) for simpler AI agent discovery
  - `assets/` = Subfolders ALLOWED for grouping related templates
  - `scripts/` = Typically flat, subfolders OK for large collections
- **Templates updated** — `skill_md_template.md` with "Folder Organization Principle" section; `skill_creation.md` with folder guidance

### Fixes

- **Duplicate file removed** — Deleted duplicate `INSTALL_GUIDE.md` in mcp-figma skill root
- **Broken paths fixed** — Fixed 3 broken paths in mcp-figma (removed erroneous `/MCP/` from paths)

## Files Changed

35+ files updated with path references; 2 file operations (delete duplicate, fix paths)
