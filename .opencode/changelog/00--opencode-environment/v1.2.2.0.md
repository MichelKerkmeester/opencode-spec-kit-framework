**Coding Analysis Lenses** — New framework for improved code quality decisions with 6 lenses and anti-pattern detection.

---

## Highlights

### New Coding Analysis Framework

- **6 Coding Lenses**: CLARITY (simplicity), SYSTEMS (dependencies), BIAS (wrong problem), SUSTAINABILITY (maintainability), VALUE (actual impact), SCOPE (complexity matching)
- **6 Anti-Patterns**: Over-engineering, Premature optimization, Cargo culting, Gold-plating, Wrong abstraction, Scope creep with trigger phrases and responses
- **Solution Flow Integration**: Added SYSTEMS → BIAS → SCOPE lens steps to request analysis workflow
- **Enhanced Simplicity First**: CLARITY lens triggers requiring justification before proceeding
- **LENS VALIDATION**: New checklist section in PRE-CHANGE VALIDATION
- **Extended Failure Patterns**: Patterns 17-20 with lens-based detection

### Changed

- **Threshold Alignment**: Renamed "Legacy thresholds" to "Simple thresholds" for confidence-only queries
- **Dual-Threshold Alignment**: Aligned percentages with dual-threshold: 40-69% PROCEED WITH CAUTION, ≥70% PASS
