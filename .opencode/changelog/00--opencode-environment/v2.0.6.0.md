## Highlights

### AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md Condensation

- ASCII box gates → structured markdown headers with bullets and blockquotes
- §3 (Consolidated Question Protocol) merged into §2 (Gates) as sub-section
- §4-§6 condensed: duplicated content replaced with references to system-spec-kit SKILL.md
- Agent Definitions: table → bullet list
- @speckit Exclusivity block removed (lives in SKILL.md §1)
- Renumbered 1-8 (was 1-9), internal cross-references updated

### AGENTS_FULL_STACK.md (New)

Anonymized multi-stack variant for public repos, based on:
- `sk-code--full-stack`: Stack detection (Go, Swift, React Native, React/Next.js, Node.js), 3-phase lifecycle, verification commands
- `sk-git`: Worktree, commit, finish sub-workflows
- Same condensed formatting as base AGENTS.md
