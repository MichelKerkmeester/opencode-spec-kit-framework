Enforced **AGENTS.md routing rules** across all **33 command files**, reorganized **14 changelog directories** with a consistent numbering scheme, and added **SKILL.md agent dispatch documentation**. Validated with **204 verification checks** and **18/18 sub-agent simulation tests**.

## Highlights

### 🏗️ Agent Routing Compliance (Spec 014)

The create and spec_kit commands lacked formal agent routing — sub-agents like @debug, @research, @review, and @handover were not referenced in command YAML files. Spec 014 audited all 33 command files and added AGENTS.md-compliant routing directives to each one.

- **Create commands** (18 files): @speckit for spec folder creation (Rule 5), @context for discovery (Rule 4), @review for quality gates (Section 3)
- **Spec_kit commands** (15 files): @debug at failure >= 3, @research on confidence < 60%, dual-phase @review (Mode 2 Pre-Commit + Mode 4 Gate Validation), @handover at session end
- **204/204 verification checks** passed across all routing changes

### 🧪 Sub-Agent Simulation Test Suite

A full test suite was built to validate the new routing without requiring live Claude sessions. An orchestrator dispatches 7 test agents in 3 batches, each simulating YAML workflow execution with scripted inputs and fixture data.

- **18 tests**: 7 happy paths + 11 error/edge cases across plan, implement, complete, research, debug, resume, handover
- **Artifact verification**: Each test checks for correct file generation, placeholder replacement, and quality gate behavior
- **18/18 PASS**: All tests verified — artifact generation, quality gates, error handling, and agent routing confirmed working

### 📝 SKILL.md + README.md Updates (Spec 119)

The system-spec-kit documentation was missing agent routing details added by spec 014. SKILL.md now includes a full Agent Dispatch table, and README.md documents the new mode suffixes available for `/spec_kit:complete`.

- **Agent Dispatch table**: Documents all agent routing in spec_kit commands (@debug, @review, @research, @handover with trigger conditions)
- **Mode Suffixes expanded**: `:with-research` and `:auto-debug` flags documented for `/spec_kit:complete`
- **Agent Exclusivity**: `debug-delegation.md` added as @debug exception

### 📋 Changelog Reorganization

The changelog directory structure was inconsistent — some directories used old naming conventions, and patch versions cluttered the history. All 14 directories were renumbered with a consistent `##--name` prefix scheme, and patch versions were consolidated into their parent series.

- **14 changelog directories** renumbered: `00--opencode-environment` through `13--mcp-figma`
- **New directories**: `02--agents-md`, `03--agent-orchestration`, `04--commands` added for previously undocumented areas
- **Patch consolidation**: Minor patch entries merged into series versions for cleaner navigation
