## [**2.1.3.3**] - 2026-02-18

**Memory indexing release-doc patch** -- Clarified `/memory:save` manual retry guidance so full-folder re-index examples explicitly include workflow skill reference scanning (`includeSkillRefs: true`). This is a **documentation-only patch** with **1 command example fix** plus release metadata synchronization.

---

## Highlights

### Category: Documentation

- **Explicit scan scope in retry example**: Updated the `/memory:save` full-folder retry snippet to pass `includeSkillRefs: true`, matching new workflows-code indexing behavior.
- **Reduced operator ambiguity**: Prevents false-negative expectations when validating `skillRefFiles` after restart and re-scan.

### Category: Commands

- **Memory command alignment**: `/memory:save` docs now match `/memory:manage scan` source-scope semantics for skill `references/` and `assets/` indexing.

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/command/memory/save.md`
- `.opencode/changelog/04--commands/v2.0.4.1.md`

## Upgrade

No action required. Pull latest to get the clarified memory re-index command example and release metadata updates.
