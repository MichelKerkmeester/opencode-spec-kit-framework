## [**2.0.3.0**] - 2026-02-15

**README Documentation Infrastructure** — Added 469 memory-indexing anchor pairs and fixed 59 HVR violations across 70 README files in `.opencode/skill/`. Created new global `skill/README.md` (spec 013).

> Spec folder: `specs/001-opencode-env/013-readme-human-voice-alignment/` (Level 3)

## Highlights

### Documentation Infrastructure

- **Memory indexing anchors** — Added `<!-- ANCHOR:name -->` / `<!-- /ANCHOR:name -->` pairs around every H2 section in 70 README files, enabling Spec Kit Memory to index and retrieve README content by section
- **HVR compliance pass** — Fixed 59 remaining Human Voice Rules violations (predominantly three-item inline list restructuring) across all skill README files
- **YAML frontmatter** — Verified presence on all 74 README paths. Added missing frontmatter to `templates/scratch/README.md` (the only file lacking it)

### New

- **skill/README.md** — Created global Skills Library overview (302 lines, 8 anchor pairs) covering all 9 skills with catalog, routing guide and creation instructions

## Upgrade

No action required. Pull latest. README content is unchanged — only structural markup (anchors) and minor text edits (HVR compliance) were added.
