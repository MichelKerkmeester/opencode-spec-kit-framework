## [**1.3.0.0**] - 2026-02-10

**Agent Fleet Overhaul** — Created `@context` agent, established Two-Tier Dispatch architecture, added FAST PATH to all 6 work agents, removed dead code, standardized models, and compressed all agent prompts by 23.1% (5,176 → 3,982 lines).

> Spec folder: `004-agents/007-explore-sub-agent` (Level 2)

## Highlights

### New Features

- **Context retrieval agent** — Created `.opencode/agent/context.md` (716 lines). Specialized context scout with 3 thoroughness levels (quick/medium/thorough), Memory MCP integration, and structured Context Package output
- **Two-Tier Dispatch Model** — Phase 1: `@context` gathers context → Phase 2: orchestrator dispatches implementation agents with that Context Package. Eliminates redundant exploration across agents
- **@explore prohibition (Rule 4)** — `orchestrate.md` §6 now prohibits direct `@explore` dispatch. Only `@context` can internally dispatch the built-in `@explore` subagent type
- **Low-complexity bypass** — Added `§1.1 FAST PATH & CONTEXT PACKAGE` section to all 6 work agents (`research`, `write`, `review`, `debug`, `speckit`, `handover`). Low-complexity tasks skip ceremony; agents pre-loaded with Context Package skip Layer 1 memory checks
- **Complexity signaling** — Added `Complexity: [low|medium|high]` field to `orchestrate.md` §11 Task Decomposition Format with estimation heuristic table. Agents use this to decide FAST PATH vs full workflow

### Changed

- **orchestrate.md** — 39.7% reduction (1,316 → 793 lines). Aggressive prompt compression across 10 sections; all `@explore` dispatch references replaced with `@context`. Agent Selection Matrix and Routing Logic updated. Pre-Delegation Reasoning format now includes complexity line
- **research.md** — 42.4% reduction (793 → 457 lines). Aggressive compression with low-complexity bypass added
- **write.md** — 59.2% reduction (847 → 346 lines). Largest reduction; most aggressive trimming of all agents
- **review.md** — 50.6% reduction (810 → 400 lines). Aggressive compression with low-complexity bypass added
- **debug.md** — 38.0% reduction (703 → 436 lines). Aggressive compression with low-complexity bypass added
- **speckit.md** — 24.5% reduction (649 → 490 lines). Moderate compression with low-complexity bypass added
- **handover.md** — +2.4% growth (336 → 344 lines). FAST PATH added; grew slightly due to new section
- **Model standardization** — All agents → `github-copilot/claude-*`. Heavy agents (research, review, debug) use `claude-opus-4.6`. Lighter agents (write, speckit, handover, context) use `claude-sonnet-4.5`. Orchestrate has no model (primary mode, delegates only)

### Cleanup

- **Dead Coordinator Mode** — Removed §9-§10 from `research.md` (coordinator/worker dispatch code). Agent has `task: deny` so this was unreachable dead code
- **Dead Worker Mode** — Removed §4-§5 from `debug.md` (coordinator/worker dispatch code). Same reason: `task: deny` makes it unreachable

## Files Changed

- `.opencode/agent/context.md` (new)
- `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md`
- `.opencode/agent/research.md`
- `.opencode/agent/write.md`
- `.opencode/agent/review.md`
- `.opencode/agent/debug.md`
- `.opencode/agent/speckit.md`
- `.opencode/agent/handover.md`
