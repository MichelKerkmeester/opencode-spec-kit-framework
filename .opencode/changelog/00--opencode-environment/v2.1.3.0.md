## [**2.1.3.0**] - 2026-02-18

**Agent model upgrade to Sonnet 4.6** — Upgraded the entire Copilot agent fleet from haiku-4.5/sonnet-4.5 to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, removed hard-pinned opus from research and debug agents so they inherit the dispatching parent's model, and promoted context, handover, and review in `.claude/agents/` to `sonnet`. **10 files** updated across two agent directories.

## Highlights

### Category: Features

- **Copilot fleet upgrade**: context, handover, review, speckit, write all moved to `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6`
- **Parent model inheritance**: research and debug agents no longer hard-pin opus — they now inherit whichever model dispatched them, enabling flexible model assignment without file edits
- **Claude Code agents**: context and handover promoted from `haiku` → `sonnet`; review promoted from `opus` → `sonnet`
- **Review comment updated**: `copilot/review.md` had a stale "keep model-agnostic" convention comment; updated to reflect the new pinned model
