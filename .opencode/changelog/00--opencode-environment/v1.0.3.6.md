## [**1.0.3.6**] - 2026-01-15

**MCP Protocol Fix & Skill Expansion** — Critical JSON-RPC fix for Cognitive Memory v17.1; VS Code extension guide; 15+ new reference files for workflows-code skill.

---

## Highlights

### Fixed

- **Critical (MCP Protocol)** — Changed `console.log` → `console.error` in 3 locations to prevent "invalid character 'v'" JSON-RPC errors:
  - `embeddings.js:282` (Provider warmed up message)
  - `factory.js:58` (Using provider message)
  - `factory.js:110` (Warming up message)
  - MCP servers use stdout for JSON-RPC communication; any `console.log()` output corrupts the protocol, causing Antigravity quota and other MCP tools to fail

### New

- **VS Code Extension Install Guide** — Step-by-step installation guide for non-technical users (`OpenCode - VS Code Extension.md`): AI-first installation prompt, GitHub Copilot authentication walkthrough, model selection guidance
- **Performance Patterns Asset** — `performance_patterns.js` with production-validated timing utilities: Throttle/debounce constants (64ms pointermove, 180ms form validation, 200-250ms resize), IntersectionObserver patterns with 0.1 threshold
- **15 New Reference Files** — Expanded workflows-code skill with comprehensive pattern documentation:
  - Debugging: `debugging_workflows.md`, `error_recovery.md`
  - Implementation: `animation_workflows.md`, `css_patterns.md`, `focus_management.md`, `implementation_workflows.md`, `observer_patterns.md`, `performance_patterns.md`, `security_patterns.md`, `swiper_patterns.md`, `third_party_integrations.md`, `webflow_patterns.md`
  - Standards: `css_quick_reference.md`
  - Verification: `verification_workflows.md`

## Files Changed

- `embeddings.js` (MODIFIED)
- `factory.js` (MODIFIED)
- `OpenCode - VS Code Extension.md` (NEW)
- `performance_patterns.js` (NEW)
- workflows-code skill: 15 new reference files (NEW)

## Upgrade

No action required. Pull latest to get the MCP protocol fix and documentation.

**Note**: This release completes the Cognitive Memory v17.1 rollout by fixing the MCP protocol issue that could prevent the memory system from functioning. The cognitive features themselves (attention-decay, co-activation, tier-classifier, working-memory, summary-generator) were released in v1.0.3.4 and v1.0.3.5.
