## [**1.0.3.4**] - 2026-01-14

**Cognitive Memory v17.1 & Workflow Audit** — Cognitive Memory v17.1 delivers comprehensive bug fixes to the session-aware memory system introduced in v17.0. Additionally, a comprehensive audit of 4 workflow skills resolved 9 critical bugs, 13 misalignments, and 18 warnings across 13 files.

## Highlights

### Cognitive Memory Features (v17.0)

- **Turn-Based Attention Decay** — Memories fade naturally over conversation turns unless re-activated. Decay rates vary by importance tier (constitutional=1.0/never, normal=0.80, temporary=0.60)
- **Tiered Content Delivery** — HOT (≥0.8): full content, WARM (0.25-0.79): summaries only, COLD (<0.25): excluded. Achieves 63-86% token savings in typical sessions
- **Co-Activation** — When a memory activates, related memories get boosted (+0.35), surfacing contextually relevant content automatically
- **Session-Based Working Memory** — Each conversation maintains independent attention state. Fully backward compatible with stateless mode
- **New Module `working-memory.js`** — Session state management
- **New Module `attention-decay.js`** — Turn-based decay calculations
- **New Module `tier-classifier.js`** — HOT/WARM/COLD classification
- **New Module `co-activation.js`** — Related memory boosting
- **New Module `summary-generator.js`** — WARM tier summary generation

### Workflow Skills Audit

- **sk-git v1.5.0** — Full Git workflow orchestrator for complete development lifecycle: workspace setup guidance via git-worktrees, clean commit workflows with conventional commit conventions, work completion flows for branch integration, pull request creation and review workflows, GitHub issue integration, fixed 7 GitHub MCP naming patterns (underscore → dot notation), added Gate 3 integration and memory integration examples
- **workflows-chrome-devtools v2.1.0** — Enhanced orchestrator with intelligent routing: CLI (bdg) approach prioritized for speed and token efficiency, MCP fallback for multi-tool integration scenarios, screenshot capture, network monitoring, console log access, cookie manipulation and JavaScript execution, Unix pipe composability for terminal-based automation, fixed section references in session_management.md and cdp_patterns.md
- **workflows-documentation** — Validation improvements: added SMART ROUTING and REFERENCES sections to package_skill.py validation, fixed Resource Router mode numbering (6 duplicates → 4 unique), added REFERENCES section to init_skill.py template
- **workflows-code** — Audit bug fixes: fixed 15 broken asset and relative paths across 3 reference files, viewport alignment standardized to 375px, removed 60 lines of dead code from wait_patterns.js
- **Version Alignment** — All package versions updated to 17.1.0 for consistency
