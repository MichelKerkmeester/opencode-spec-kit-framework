## [**2.1.3.5**] - 2026-02-19

**Hybrid memory platform rollout plus Claude runtime-path finalization** -- Ships the large Spec Kit Memory retrieval/runtime upgrade from `136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag` and finalizes Claude command/runtime path normalization to `/.claude/agents` after removing the legacy mirrored agent tree.

---

## Highlights

### Category: System Spec Kit

- **Memory retrieval stack upgraded**: Added typed retrieval traces, artifact-aware routing, intent-adaptive fusion, and extraction/provenance hardening in Spec Kit Memory MCP runtime.
- **Observability and auditability expanded**: Added extended retrieval telemetry and an append-only mutation ledger for memory state mutations.
- **Operational rollout artifacts completed**: Wave-based spec documentation and completion evidence landed under `136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag`.

### Category: Agent Runtime Pathing

- **Claude runtime source normalized**: Removed legacy `.opencode/agent/claude` mirror and standardized runtime guidance to `/.claude/agents`.
- **Policy mapping aligned**: `AGENTS.md` and command runtime mapping sections now consistently reference the finalized Claude path.

### Category: Commands

- **Command path guidance corrected**: Updated `/create:*` and `/spec_kit:*` command docs to use `/.claude/agents`.
- **Memory command docs refreshed**: Added adaptive-fusion, telemetry, and mutation-ledger behavior notes across memory command guides.

### Category: Documentation and Release Artifacts

- **Component changelogs added**: Published targeted release notes for system-spec-kit, agent-orchestration, and commands subcomponents.
- **Legacy root changelog fragments removed**: Old top-level `changelog/v2.1.3.1.md` and `changelog/v2.1.3.3.md` were removed in favor of subfoldered component changelogs.
