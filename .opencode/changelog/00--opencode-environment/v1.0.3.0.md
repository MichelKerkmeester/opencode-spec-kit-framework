## [**1.0.3.0**] - 2026-01-04

**Dual Specs Location Support** — Memory files and spec folders can now be stored in either `specs/` or `.opencode/specs/` for flexible project organization.

---

## Highlights

### New Features

- **Dual specs location support** — Both `specs/` (project root) and `.opencode/specs/` now supported for spec folders and memory files
- **Precedence rule** — Project root location takes precedence if both exist

### Changes

- **Path validation updated** — `context-server.js` handles dual locations
- **Directory scanning enhanced** — `memory-parser.js` scans both `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` directories
- **Context generation flexible** — `generate-context.js` supports spec folder in either location
- **Configuration updated** — `config.js` path configuration for dual support
- **Workflow awareness** — `workflow.js` dual location awareness
- **Data collection paths** — `collect-session-data.js` updated for both locations
- **Directory creation logic** — `directory-setup.js` creates folders in correct location
- **Spec detection improved** — `folder-detector.js` detects specs in both locations
- **Documentation examples** — `MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md` updated with dual location examples

### Fixes

- **Cross-repo symlink corrected** — `INSTALL_GUIDE.md` in Public repo now points locally instead of to external project

## Files Changed

10 files updated across path validation, scanning, configuration, and documentation

## Upgrade

No action required. Existing `specs/` folders continue to work unchanged.
