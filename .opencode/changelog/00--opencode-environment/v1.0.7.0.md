## [**1.0.7.0**] - 2026-01-23

**Multi-Agent System Upgrade** — Comprehensive upgrade introducing 7 specialized agents with enterprise orchestration patterns including Circuit Breaker isolation, Saga Compensation, Quality Gates, and dedicated agents for review, research, debugging, and session handover.

---

## Highlights

### New Specialized Agents

- **@research** — Technical investigation with evidence gathering → `/spec_kit:research` (Steps 3-7)
- **@speckit** — Spec folder documentation for Level 1-3+ → `/spec_kit:plan` (Step 3)
- **@review** — Code review with pattern validation (READ-ONLY) → `/spec_kit:implement` (Step 11)
- **@debug** — 4-phase methodology (Observe → Analyze → Hypothesize → Fix) → `/spec_kit:debug`
- **@handover** — Session continuation specialist (Sonnet default) → `/spec_kit:handover`

### Enhanced Agents

- **@orchestrate** — Senior orchestration with task decomposition, delegation, quality evaluation
- **@write** — Documentation generation and maintenance

### Enterprise Orchestration Patterns

- **Circuit Breaker** — Isolates failing agents with 3-state system (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN), 3-failure threshold, 60-second timeout
- **Saga Compensation** — Reverse-order rollback on multi-task failures with logged compensation actions
- **Quality Gates** — Pre/mid/post execution scoring with 70-point threshold rubrics
- **Resource Budgeting** — 50K token default budget with 80% warning and 100% halt thresholds
- **Conditional Branching** — IF/THEN/ELSE logic in task decomposition with 3-level nesting support
- **Incremental Checkpointing** — Every 5 tasks or 10 tool calls for recovery

## Changed

### Command Integration

- **Agent Routing** — 4 commands now route to specialized agents:
  - `/spec_kit:research` → `@research` (Steps 3-7)
  - `/spec_kit:plan` → `@speckit` (Step 3)
  - `/spec_kit:implement` → `@review` (Step 11)
  - `/spec_kit:handover` → `@handover` (dedicated Sonnet agent)

## Files Changed

- Agent system files (5 new sub-agents, 2 enhanced agents)
- Command routing configuration (4 updated commands)
- Orchestration framework (circuit breaker, saga compensation, quality gates)
