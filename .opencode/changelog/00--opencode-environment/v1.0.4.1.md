## [**1.0.4.1**] - 2026-01-16

**Constitutional Indexer Fix** — README.md files in constitutional directory no longer incorrectly indexed as memory entries.

---

## Highlights

### Fixed

- **Constitutional Indexer** — Now skips `README.md` files (case-insensitive) in `find_constitutional_files()` to prevent documentation from being indexed as memories
- **Memory File Validator** — `is_memory_file()` now excludes README.md files from constitutional directories during `memory_save` operations

## Files Changed

- `find_constitutional_files()` (MODIFIED)
- `is_memory_file()` validator (MODIFIED)

## Upgrade

No action required. Pull latest to get the fix. Any previously indexed README memories can be removed with `memory_delete({ id: <id> })`.
