## [**1.2.0.0**] - 2026-02-03

**SpecKit Reimagined — Agent File Updates** — Updated handover, speckit, and write agents with new memory integration patterns, ANCHOR format validation, and validate_document.py workflow.

---

## Highlights

### Changed
- **`handover.md`**: Simplified Task dispatch syntax — removed model-specific examples (`model: "sonnet"`, `model: "opus"`, `model: "gemini"`), replaced with generic `description:` and `session_id:` approach. Model selection now delegated to orchestration layer.
- **`speckit.md`**: Added MCP Tool Layers table (L1-L5), memory folder updated to "5-state model, ANCHOR format". Added 5 `/memory:*` commands to commands table. New Section 11.5 "TEMPLATE PATTERNS (Spec 082)" with workstream prefixes `[W:XXXX]`, block-task references `[B:T###]`, evidence log format `[E:filename]`. Added pre-flight validation gates (4 gates) and ANCHOR format validation. Added response envelope structure template.
- **`write.md`**: Step 3 (LOAD TEMPLATE) made hard gate with explicit HALT. Step 8 changed from "VALIDATE ALIGNMENT" to "VALIDATE FORMAT" using `validate_document.py` (blocking, exit code based). Step 10 delivery now gated on validation pass AND DQI >= 75. Updated Mermaid flowchart with gate decision nodes.
