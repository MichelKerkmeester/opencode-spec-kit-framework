## [**2.1.0.1**] - 2026-02-25

**Ultra-think stabilization release with orchestrator parity across all runtime folders.** Caps Ultra-think strategy fan-out to a maximum of 3, aligns depth semantics with single-hop NDP expectations, and updates orchestrator routing in OpenCode, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to include `@ultra-think` consistently. Codex adapters now reference canonical OpenCode orchestrator/ultra-think playbooks.

## Highlights

### Category: Ultra-Think Runtime Hardening

- **Strategy cap reduced from max 5 to max 3** across OpenCode, ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini ultra-think adapters.
- **Depth contract clarified**: depth 0 is direct user invocation; depth 1 is orchestrator/agent-dispatched LEAF execution.
- **Timeout scoring behavior normalized**: timed-out strategies are marked `N/A` and excluded from scored totals.
- **Depth-1 guardrail added**: consume orchestrator-provided context first and avoid broad exploration.

### Category: Orchestrator Routing Parity

- **`@ultra-think` added to routing tables** in all orchestrator runtime docs (OpenCode, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini).
- **LEAF constraints updated** to include `@ultra-think` in no-nested-dispatch enforcement lists.
- **Task format schemas updated** to allow `@ultra-think` as a first-class dispatch target.
- **Context-window safety wording aligned**: replaced "Write, don't hold" with delegate-persistence guidance for orchestrator-safe summaries.

### Category: Codex Canonical Path Alignment

- **Codex adapter references switched to canonical OpenCode playbooks**:
  - `.codex/agents/ultra-think.toml` now points to `.opencode/agent/ultra-think.md`
  - `.codex/agents/orchestrate.toml` now points to `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md`
