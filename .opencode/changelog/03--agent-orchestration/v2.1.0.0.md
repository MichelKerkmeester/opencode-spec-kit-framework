## [**2.1.0.0**] - 2026-02-25

**New @ultra-think agent: multi-strategy planning architect across 5 runtime platforms.** Dispatches N diverse thinking strategies (Analytical, Creative, Critical, Pragmatic, Holistic), scores results via a 5-dimension rubric, and synthesizes the optimal plan for user review. Planning-only: reads and searches but never modifies files.

## Highlights

### Category: New Agent (ultra-think)

- **Multi-strategy planning agent added across all 5 platforms.** Dispatches 2-5 diverse thinking strategies per task, each with a distinct reasoning lens and temperature setting. Scores all results via a 5-dimension rubric (Correctness, Completeness, Elegance, Robustness, Integration) and synthesizes the best elements into a unified plan.
- **Planning-only permissions enforced.** The agent has read and search access for analysis but cannot modify files. Write, Edit, and Bash are explicitly denied. Output is always a plan with implementation steps for user review.
- **Primary agent (not a subagent).** Configured as `mode: primary` on platforms that support it. Users invoke it directly for complex tasks that benefit from multi-perspective analysis.

### Category: Platform Adapters

- **OpenCode/Copilot** (`.opencode/agent/ultra-think.md`): Canonical definition with Task tool for parallel strategy subagent dispatch and sequential_thinking for NDP-compliant depth-1 mode.
- **ChatGPT** (`.opencode/agent/chatgpt/ultra-think.md`): Adds adaptive modes (Quick N=2, Standard N=3, Deep N=4-5) and configurable reasoning effort.
- **Gemini CLI** (`.gemini/agents/ultra-think.md`): Tools limited to `read_file`, `grep_search`, `list_directory`. Multi-pass dispatch at depth 0, sequential processing at depth 1. Max 30 turns, 20-minute timeout.
- **Codex** (`.codex/agents/ultra-think.toml`): Read-only sandbox, xhigh reasoning effort. References the ChatGPT playbook as canonical.
- **Claude Code** (`.claude/agents/ultra-think.md`): Tools limited to Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, Task. Strategy subagents dispatched with `model: "sonnet"` for cost/latency efficiency while Opus-level synthesis handles scoring.

### Category: HVR Compliance

- **All agent files follow Human Voice Rules (v0.210).** Em-dashes replaced with commas, full stops, or colons throughout. Descriptions use natural phrasing.

### Category: Documentation Updates

- **AGENTS.md updated**: `@ultra-think` added to Agent Definitions in both the universal template and the full-stack enterprise example.
- **README.md updated**: Agent count incremented to 11. `@ultra-think` added to the All Agents table with planning-only role description.

## Upgrade

No migration required. The new agent is opt-in. Invoke it directly when multi-strategy planning analysis is needed for complex tasks.
