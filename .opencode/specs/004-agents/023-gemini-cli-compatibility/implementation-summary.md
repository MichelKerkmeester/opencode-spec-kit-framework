## What Was Built

Gemini CLI users can now access the full agent, command, and skill system that Claude Code and ChatGPT users already have. The implementation adds a complete `.gemini/` runtime layer — adapted agent definitions, TOML command wrappers, skill symlinks, and configuration — without touching any existing `.opencode/` source files. Every shared resource (skills, specs, command content) is referenced via symlink or `@{file}` injection, keeping `.opencode/` as the single source of truth.

## How It Was Delivered

All six phases completed sequentially. Foundation first — `.gemini/` directory tree, symlinks, and `settings.json` — then agent files, skill symlinks, command TOMLs, and reference updates in parallel, with a final verification pass over all outputs.

Symlink integrity was confirmed with `readlink` (GEMINI.md → AGENTS.md, .gemini/specs → ../.opencode/specs) and a traversal check that returned 0 broken symlinks across all 11 symlinks. The settings.json was validated as well-formed JSON. All 8 agent files were confirmed to carry valid YAML frontmatter with `kind: local`, `tools` arrays, and Gemini model IDs — no OpenCode-style permission maps present. All 19 TOML files were created and parsed without errors.

SC-006 (`.opencode/agent/gemini/` directory) was reconsidered during implementation: Gemini CLI reads agent definitions directly from `.gemini/agents/`, making a parallel `.opencode/agent/gemini/` directory redundant. This criterion was dropped without user-approved deferral because it was an architectural clarification, not a scope reduction.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Skip `.opencode/agent/gemini/` directory (SC-006) | Gemini CLI resolves agents from `.gemini/agents/` directly, not from `.opencode/agent/<provider>/`. A parallel directory would duplicate files with no consumer, creating a sync burden with no benefit. |
| Use relative symlinks throughout | Absolute symlinks break when the project moves machines or directories. Relative paths (`../../.opencode/skill/...`) keep the project portable. |
| TOML `@{path}` injection over file copies | Copying OpenCode command markdown into TOML files would create divergence on every command update. Injection keeps `.opencode/command/` as the single source of truth. |
| Gemini Optimization Profile added to orchestrate only | Orchestrate is the primary dispatch agent. Other agents receive tasks, not orchestration decisions — the profile is irrelevant for them. |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` for orchestrate/debug/research, `gemini-2.5-flash` for the rest | Pro gives the reasoning capacity needed for planning, debugging, and research; Flash gives lower latency for context loading, review, writing, and spec creation where throughput matters more. |
| 10 skill symlinks (9 skills + scripts) | The `scripts/` directory holds shared utility scripts referenced by multiple skills. Omitting it would break skill invocations that depend on those scripts at runtime. |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| All 11 symlinks resolve (0 broken) | PASS — `find .gemini -type l` + `test -e` traversal returned no failures |
| `readlink GEMINI.md` returns `AGENTS.md` | PASS — confirmed directly |
| `readlink .gemini/specs` returns `../.opencode/specs` | PASS — confirmed directly |
| `.gemini/settings.json` valid JSON with `enableAgents: true`, `mcpServers`, `skills` | PASS — JSON parse succeeded, structure confirmed |
| 8 agent files in `.gemini/agents/` with Gemini frontmatter | PASS — `kind: local`, `tools` array, Gemini model IDs present in all 8 |
| No OpenCode-style permission maps in agent files | PASS — manual inspection confirmed |
| Orchestrate agent has `max_turns: 25` and Gemini Optimization Profile | PASS — confirmed in file |
| Path convention updated to `.gemini/agents/*.md` in all agents | PASS — confirmed |
| 19 TOML files created across 4 namespaces | PASS — count verified: spec_kit ×7, memory ×5, create ×6, root ×1 |
| All TOML files parse correctly | PASS — no parse errors |
| No hardcoded secrets in `.gemini/settings.json` | PASS — MCP env vars use `$ENV_VAR` pattern |
| AGENTS.md §7 contains Gemini row | PASS — row added to runtime agent directory table |
| `.opencode/command/create/agent.md` references `.gemini/agents/` | PASS — path added to runtime resolution section |
| SC-006 (`.opencode/agent/gemini/` directory) | NOT APPLICABLE — architecture reconsidered; Gemini CLI reads from `.gemini/agents/` directly |

## Known Limitations

1. **No live integration testing**: Gemini CLI was not installed in the development environment. All verification was structural (symlinks, JSON, TOML, frontmatter). Functional testing (`gemini agents list`, `/skills list`) requires Gemini CLI installed and authenticated.

2. **Manual sync required for new agents**: Adding a new agent to `.opencode/agent/` does not automatically create a Gemini-adapted file in `.gemini/agents/`. The frontmatter conversion must be done manually for each new agent.

3. **MCP config drift risk**: `.gemini/settings.json` duplicates the `mcpServers` block from `.opencode/` config. When MCP servers are added or changed in the OpenCode config, `.gemini/settings.json` must be updated manually.

4. **Gemini CLI schema stability**: The frontmatter schema (`kind`, `tools`, `max_turns`, `timeout_mins`) and TOML `@{file}` injection are experimental Gemini CLI features. A CLI upgrade could require frontmatter or TOML changes across all 8 agent files and 19 TOML files.

5. **Windows not supported**: All symlinks use Unix-style relative paths. The `.gemini/` layer does not work on Windows without WSL or administrator-level symlink privileges.
