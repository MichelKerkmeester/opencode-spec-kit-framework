<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

---

## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Research scope clearly defined - GraphQL API layer for microservices communication
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Key research questions identified - Federation strategy, schema approach (code-first vs schema-first), N+1 prevention
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Codebase investigation completed - Greenfield project confirmed, no existing patterns to integrate with

---

## Research Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 17 research.md sections populated with substantive content
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No placeholder markers remaining ([YOUR_VALUE_HERE], [PLACEHOLDER])
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Sources cited for all major findings with URLs or code references
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Architecture diagram included and accurately represents recommended solution

---

## Technical Completeness

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Key question 1 answered: Federation strategy defined (Apollo Federation v2)
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Key question 2 answered: Schema approach recommended (code-first with NestJS)
- [x] CHK-022 [P0] Key question 3 answered: N+1 prevention strategy documented (DataLoader)
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Alternative approaches documented with trade-offs
- [x] CHK-024 [P1] Greenfield context properly documented throughout (not empty or N/A)

---

## Feasibility Assessment

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] Feasibility rating provided (HIGH - all libraries production-ready)
- [x] CHK-031 [P1] Performance benchmarks cited (8500 queries/sec, <200ms p95)
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Security implications assessed (JWT auth, query complexity limits, rate limiting)

---

## Documentation Quality

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Code examples are syntactically correct TypeScript/GraphQL
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Implementation guide provides actionable guidance for greenfield setup
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Troubleshooting guide covers common failure scenarios

---

## Context Preservation

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Memory file created with ANCHOR tags
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] Key decisions documented for future reference
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Greenfield project constraints documented for handoff to plan workflow
