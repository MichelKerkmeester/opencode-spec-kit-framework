## Metadata

| **Completed** | 2026-02-14 |
| **Level** | 2 |

## What Was Built

Implemented JWT-based authentication for the NestJS application, including token generation with RS256 signing, login/logout/refresh endpoints, route protection middleware via AuthGuard, and bcrypt password hashing. All 6 requirements (REQ-001 through REQ-006) are satisfied with full test coverage.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| src/auth/jwt.service.ts | Created | JWT token generation, validation, and refresh logic using RS256 |
| src/auth/auth.controller.ts | Created | Login, logout, and token refresh HTTP endpoints |
| src/auth/auth.middleware.ts | Created | AuthGuard route protection middleware using Passport |
| src/auth/auth.module.ts | Created | Auth module configuration and dependency wiring |
| src/users/users.service.ts | Modified | Added password verification method with bcrypt |
| src/auth/jwt.service.spec.ts | Created | Unit tests for JwtService (sign, verify, refresh) |
| test/auth.e2e-spec.ts | Created | Integration tests for full login/refresh/logout flow |
| package.json | Modified | Added passport, @nestjs/jwt, bcrypt dependencies |
| config/keys/rsa-private.pem | Created | RSA private key for RS256 token signing |
| config/keys/rsa-public.pem | Created | RSA public key for RS256 token verification |

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| RS256 over HS256 for JWT signing | Asymmetric keys allow public key distribution for verification without exposing signing capability |
| bcrypt cost factor 12 | Balances security with performance per NFR-S02; ~250ms hash time acceptable for login flow |
| In-memory token blacklist for logout | Sufficient for MVP; Redis-backed blacklist planned for production scale |
| Rate limiting via NestJS throttler | Native integration, configurable per-route, satisfies brute force mitigation |

---

## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | Full login/refresh/logout cycle verified via Postman |
| Unit | Pass | 12 tests passing for JwtService (sign, verify, expired, malformed) |
| Integration | Pass | 8 e2e tests covering login flow, invalid creds, token refresh, logout |

### Checklist Verification

- Total items verified: 18/18
- P0 status: 8/8 complete
- P1 status: 8/8 complete
- P2 status: 2/2 complete (including README update)
- Deferred P2 items: None
- See `checklist.md` for full verification marks

---

## Deviations from Plan

| Deviation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Added rate limiting task (T010) | Not in original spec but identified during implementation as security requirement per risk table |
| In-memory blacklist instead of Redis | Simplified MVP scope; Redis integration deferred to follow-up ticket |

---

## Skill Updates

- No skill file updates required for this implementation.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Configure Redis-backed token blacklist for production deployment
2. Add monitoring alerts for 401/403 rate spikes (per rollback plan)
3. Enable auth feature flag in staging for phased rollout
4. Plan OAuth2/social login feature (noted as out-of-scope in spec)

---

## Browser Testing Results

- Not applicable; backend-only implementation with no UI components.
- API endpoints tested via Postman and integration test suite.

---

## Known Limitations

- Token blacklist is in-memory and will not persist across server restarts
- Rate limiting is per-instance, not distributed across multiple nodes
- No OAuth2 or social login support (deferred per spec scope)
