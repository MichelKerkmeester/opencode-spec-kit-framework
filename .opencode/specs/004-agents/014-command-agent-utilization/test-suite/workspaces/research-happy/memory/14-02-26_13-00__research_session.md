## Research Summary

Comprehensive research on WebSocket-based real-time collaboration patterns for document editing within a NestJS/TypeScript application. The investigation covered WebSocket library selection, conflict resolution strategies (CRDT vs OT), horizontal scaling patterns, and a three-phase implementation rollout.

**Key Findings**:
1. Yjs CRDT provides eventual consistency without central coordination, outperforming OT for scalability
2. NestJS WebSocket Gateway integrates seamlessly with existing JWT auth guards and middleware
3. Redis pub/sub adapter enables horizontal scaling across multiple NestJS instances
4. The `ws` library handles ~50,000 concurrent connections per node with 4GB RAM

**Feasibility**: HIGH - All required libraries are production-ready and integrate with the existing NestJS/TypeORM stack.

**Recommended Architecture**: NestJS WebSocket Gateway + ws transport + Yjs CRDT + Redis pub/sub + PostgreSQL persistence

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: CRDT over OT for Conflict Resolution
- **Choice**: Yjs (CRDT) over ShareDB (OT)
- **Rationale**: CRDTs are inherently decentralized, eliminating the single-point-of-failure of OT's central transformation server. Yjs benchmarks show sub-millisecond merge operations. Offline editing support comes naturally with CRDTs.
- **Trade-off**: Higher initial complexity in understanding CRDT concepts, but lower operational complexity at scale.

### Decision 2: ws over Socket.IO for Transport
- **Choice**: ws library via @nestjs/platform-ws
- **Rationale**: Lighter footprint, higher performance (50k vs 30k connections per node), native binary message support. Socket.IO's features (rooms, namespaces, HTTP fallback) can be replicated with minimal custom code.
- **Trade-off**: No automatic HTTP long-polling fallback for corporate proxies. Mitigation: implement fallback for enterprise deployments if needed.

### Decision 3: Three-Phase Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Basic WebSocket connectivity with presence awareness (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Yjs CRDT integration for collaborative editing (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Redis-based horizontal scaling and monitoring (2-3 weeks)
- **Rationale**: Incremental delivery reduces risk. Each phase provides standalone value and can be deployed independently.

## Scaling Research

**Horizontal Scaling Pattern**: Redis pub/sub adapter distributes WebSocket messages across server instances.
- Sticky sessions required on load balancer (IP hash or cookie-based)
- Redis Cluster for high availability
- Expected capacity: linear scaling with node count (50k connections per node)

**Performance Targets**:
- Sync latency: <50ms p95
- Message throughput: 100 msg/sec per client
- Document size limit: 5MB (compaction for larger documents)

**Risks Identified**:
- CRDT complexity: MEDIUM - team needs Yjs training
- Scaling beyond 10k concurrent users: HIGH - requires Redis cluster, monitoring, load testing
- Corporate proxy WebSocket blocking: LOW - fallback to polling if needed
