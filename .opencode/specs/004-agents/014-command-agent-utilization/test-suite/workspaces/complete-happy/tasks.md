- [x] T009 Implement NotificationPreference model and preference CRUD operations (src/models/notification-preference.ts)
- [x] T010 Create REST API endpoints: GET /notifications, PATCH /notifications/:id/read, PUT /preferences (src/api/notifications.ts)
- [x] T011 Implement NotificationBell component with unread count badge and real-time updates (src/components/NotificationBell.tsx)
