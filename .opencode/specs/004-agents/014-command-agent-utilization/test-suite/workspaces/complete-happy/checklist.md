## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

---

## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md [EVIDENCE: spec.md - 7 requirements defined with acceptance criteria]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md [EVIDENCE: plan.md - event-driven architecture with WebSocket and SendGrid]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available [EVIDENCE: plan.md Section 6 - all 5 dependencies status Green]

---

## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Code passes lint/format checks [EVIDENCE: ESLint and Prettier pass with zero errors]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No console errors or warnings [EVIDENCE: Browser console clean; Node process logs clean]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error handling implemented [EVIDENCE: notification-service.ts:45-67 try/catch with retry; email-service.ts:23-41 SendGrid error mapping]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Code follows project patterns [EVIDENCE: Service pattern matches existing auth-service.ts and user-service.ts structure]

---

## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All acceptance criteria met [EVIDENCE: REQ-001 through REQ-007 verified; SC-001 through SC-004 measured]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual testing complete [EVIDENCE: End-to-end flow tested: event trigger > in-app alert (1.2s) > email received (34s)]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested [EVIDENCE: WebSocket reconnection, high volume (1000 notifications), empty preferences]
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Error scenarios validated [EVIDENCE: SendGrid timeout simulated; WebSocket disconnect/reconnect; invalid payload rejection]

---

## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets [EVIDENCE: SendGrid API key via SENDGRID_API_KEY env var; Redis password via REDIS_URL]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input validation implemented [EVIDENCE: notification.ts Zod schema validates title (max 200), body (max 2000), recipientIds (array of UUIDs)]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Auth/authz working correctly [EVIDENCE: All notification endpoints require JWT; users can only read own notifications]

---

## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized [EVIDENCE: All 20 tasks map to spec requirements; plan phases align with task phases]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Code comments adequate [EVIDENCE: JSDoc on all public methods; inline comments on complex batching logic]
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] README updated (if applicable) [EVIDENCE: README.md updated with notification system setup and environment variables]

---

## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only [EVIDENCE: No temp files outside scratch/]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion [EVIDENCE: scratch/ contains only test workspace artifacts]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Findings saved to memory/ [EVIDENCE: Memory file created with session context and ANCHOR tags]
