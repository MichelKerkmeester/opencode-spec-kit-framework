## What Was Built

A unified notification system supporting two delivery channels: real-time in-app alerts via WebSocket (Socket.IO) and email delivery via SendGrid. The system includes a central NotificationService with preference-aware routing, a background EmailWorker for async email processing with retry logic, and React components for the in-app notification UI. Users can configure per-channel, per-event-type preferences, and non-urgent emails are batched into hourly digests.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| src/services/notification-service.ts | Created | Central dispatch orchestrator with preference filtering and channel routing |
| src/services/email-service.ts | Created | SendGrid integration with template rendering and delivery tracking |
| src/services/websocket-service.ts | Modified | Added notification channel support with room-based routing |
| src/models/notification.ts | Created | Notification data model, Prisma schema, and Zod validation |
| src/models/notification-preference.ts | Created | User preference model with per-channel, per-event-type configuration |
| src/api/notifications.ts | Created | REST endpoints: GET /notifications, PATCH /:id/read, PUT /preferences |
| src/components/NotificationBell.tsx | Created | Notification bell with unread count badge and real-time updates |
| src/components/NotificationPanel.tsx | Created | Notification list with grouping, mark-all-read, and infinite scroll |
| src/migrations/20260214_notifications.sql | Created | Database schema: notifications, notification_preferences, notification_groups tables |
| src/workers/email-worker.ts | Created | BullMQ worker with retry logic, dead-letter queue, and digest compilation |
| src/config/redis.ts | Created | Redis connection configuration for BullMQ |
| tests/notification-service.test.ts | Created | 14 unit tests for dispatch, filtering, and grouping logic |
| tests/email-service.test.ts | Created | 8 unit tests for email delivery, retry, and digest batching |
| tests/api/notifications.test.ts | Created | 10 integration tests for API endpoints |
| tests/components/notification.test.tsx | Created | 6 component tests for NotificationBell and NotificationPanel |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Event-driven architecture with channel handlers | Decouples notification creation from delivery; easy to add new channels (push, SMS) later |
| BullMQ for email worker queue | Provides reliable job processing with built-in retry, backoff, and dead-letter support; Redis already in stack |
| Socket.IO over raw WebSocket | Built-in reconnection, room support, and fallback to polling; simplifies connection management |
| Zod for payload validation | Runtime type safety; generates TypeScript types; clear error messages for API consumers |
| Hourly digest batching for non-urgent emails | Reduces email fatigue; aligns with user feedback on notification overload |

---

## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | End-to-end flow verified: event > in-app (1.2s) > email (34s) |
| Unit | Pass | 22 tests passing, covering dispatch, filtering, retry, and grouping |
| Integration | Pass | 10 API endpoint tests passing; WebSocket event delivery verified |
| Component | Pass | 6 component tests passing; real-time updates and accessibility verified |

### Checklist Verification
- **Total items**: 17
- **P0 status**: 7/7 complete
- **P1 status**: 8/8 complete
- **Deferred P2 items**: None (all 2 P2 items completed)
- **Checklist link**: See `checklist.md`

## Deviations from Plan

| Planned | Actual | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Direct SMTP fallback | SendGrid-only with retry queue | SendGrid reliability sufficient; SMTP fallback adds complexity without clear benefit |
| 5 API endpoints | 3 API endpoints | Consolidated mark-read and mark-all-read into single PATCH endpoint with batch support |

---

## Skill Updates

No updates to project skills or standards required. Implementation follows existing service patterns.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Monitor SendGrid delivery rates and WebSocket connection stability in production for first week
2. Implement push notification channel (Phase 2) using same channel handler pattern
3. Add notification analytics dashboard for tracking delivery rates and user engagement
4. Consider notification template management UI for non-technical stakeholders

---

## Browser Testing Results

- Notification bell renders correctly across Chrome 121, Firefox 122, Safari 17.3
- WebSocket reconnection works reliably on network interruption simulation
- Email HTML renders correctly in Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail
