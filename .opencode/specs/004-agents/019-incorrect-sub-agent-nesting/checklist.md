<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified — 3 orchestrate.md files
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Content Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] NDP section is self-contained and referenceable by section number — NDP is now §2 in restructured orchestrate.md (lines 78-204)
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No placeholder text remains ([PLACEHOLDER], [TODO], TBD) — grep verified zero matches
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Agent tier classifications are complete (no agent missing) — all 11 agents classified in §2 Agent Tier Assignments table
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Depth counting rules are unambiguous — 5-point depth counting rules at §2:134-140
- [x] CHK-014 [P1] Legal/illegal nesting examples included — §2 with ✅/❌ emoji markers (lines 142-158)
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Workflow trace: Orchestrator > @context > @explore stays within depth 3 — Legal chain example at §2:146
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Workflow trace: Orchestrator > Sub-Orchestrator > @general stays within depth 3 — Legal chain example at §2:147
- [x] CHK-022 [P0] Workflow trace: Orchestrator > @speckit is LEAF — no sub-dispatch — Legal chain example at §2:145
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Edge case: Sub-orchestrator at depth 1 can only dispatch LEAFs at depth 2 — Documented at §2:130-131 and §3:303
- [x] CHK-024 [P1] Edge case: @context at depth 2 (from sub-orch) cannot dispatch @explore at depth 3 if max is 3 — Illegal chain at §2:154

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets (N/A — documentation only)
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] No sensitive information exposed (N/A)
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P0] All 3 orchestrate.md files have identical NDP section — chatgpt is byte-identical to base; copilot differs only in frontmatter (no model/reasoningEffort)
- [x] CHK-041 [P0] No conflicting nesting depth statements remain anywhere in any file — restructure removed all scattered references (old §3/§11/§26 merged into §2)
- [x] CHK-042 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized with actual changes — implementation-summary updated to reflect full restructure
- [x] CHK-043 [P1] Copilot Section 11 conflict resolved — conditional branching now in §3 (subsection), no separate section; nesting clarification preserved at §3:320
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only — no scratch files created during restructure
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion — N/A (none created)
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Findings saved to memory/ — context saved via generate-context.js

<!-- ANCHOR:arch-verify -->
## L3+: ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-100 [P0] Architecture decisions documented in decision-record.md — ADR-001 (3-tier) and ADR-002 (max depth 3)
- [x] CHK-101 [P1] ADR-001 (3-tier classification) has Accepted status — decision-record.md:16
- [x] CHK-102 [P1] Alternatives documented with rejection rationale — 4 alternatives for ADR-001, 3 for ADR-002
- [x] CHK-103 [P2] Future migration path noted (runtime enforcement) — implementation-summary.md limitations section
<!-- /ANCHOR:arch-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:perf-verify -->
## L3+: PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-110 [P1] No measurable token overhead beyond ~20 tokens per dispatch — `Depth: N` field adds ~5 tokens; enforcement instruction adds ~15 tokens
- [x] CHK-111 [P2] Depth tracking does not require additional tool calls — instruction-based only, no runtime tools needed
<!-- /ANCHOR:perf-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->
## L3+: DEPLOYMENT READINESS

- [x] CHK-120 [P0] Rollback procedure documented (git revert) — decision-record.md:112 and :213
- [x] CHK-121 [P1] All 3 files can be reverted independently — each file is self-contained; git checkout per file
<!-- /ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->
## L3+: COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-130 [P1] NDP rules don't contradict existing valid rules — restructure merged NDP into §2, ensuring no cross-section contradictions
- [x] CHK-131 [P1] Two-Tier Dispatch Model (Phase 1/Phase 2) preserved — §4:426-441 maintains Two-Tier Dispatch Model
<!-- /ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs-verify -->
## L3+: DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-140 [P1] All spec documents synchronized — implementation-summary updated with restructure details
- [x] CHK-141 [P1] NDP section is cross-referenced from §3, §4, §8, §9 — verified: §3:229,244,303,320 reference §2 NDP; §9:745-749 reference §2
