## What Was Built

All agent model fields across the Copilot and Claude Code agent systems were upgraded to align on `claude-sonnet-4-6` as the standard fleet model. Five Copilot agents were pinned to `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6`, two Copilot agents (research, debug) had their hard-pinned `opus-4.6` model field removed to enable orchestrator-level dispatch, and three Claude Code agents were promoted from `haiku` or `opus` to `sonnet`. A total of 10 files were changed across two directories, with a matching changelog entry published as v2.1.3.0.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/context.md` | Modified | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5` → `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/handover.md` | Modified | `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5` → `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/review.md` | Modified | Added `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` model field; removed stale "keep model-agnostic" comment |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/speckit.md` | Modified | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5` → `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/write.md` | Modified | `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5` → `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/research.md` | Modified | Deleted `model:` line (was `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6`) to enable parent model inheritance |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/debug.md` | Modified | Deleted `model:` line (was `github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6`) to enable parent model inheritance |
| `.claude/agents/context.md` | Modified | `haiku` → `sonnet` |
| `.claude/agents/handover.md` | Modified | `haiku` → `sonnet` |
| `.claude/agents/review.md` | Modified | `opus` → `sonnet` |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Uniform `claude-sonnet-4-6` for Copilot fleet | Eliminates version fragmentation; sonnet-4.5 pinned agents missed the 4.6 capability improvement; haiku agents lacked sufficient reasoning depth for context and session work |
| Remove model field from research and debug (not upgrade) | Hard-pinning opus prevented flexible model dispatch by the orchestrator; removing the field lets these agents inherit whichever model the parent dispatches, enabling cost/capability trade-offs without file edits |
| Include review.md even though it had no prior model field | review.md was model-agnostic by prior convention (spec 015) but was explicitly included in the upgrade to provide consistent review quality via pinned sonnet-4-6 |
| `sonnet` (not `claude-sonnet-4-6`) for Claude Code agents | Claude Code agents use the short-form model alias; `sonnet` maps to the current latest sonnet in the Claude Code runtime, which is claude-sonnet-4-6 at time of release |

## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | All 10 files read and model field verified after each edit |
| Unit | Skip | No executable code changed; configuration-only modification |
| Integration | Skip | Agent model dispatch is a platform concern; no local integration test surface |

## Known Limitations

- The `sonnet` alias for Claude Code agents resolves to the current latest sonnet at runtime; if Anthropic releases a `sonnet-4.7` in future, these agents will remain on `sonnet-4-6` only if the alias is updated or the field explicitly set. This is a future maintenance concern, not a defect.
- No automated test confirms that the GitHub Copilot platform resolves `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4-6` correctly — this was verified against documentation only.
