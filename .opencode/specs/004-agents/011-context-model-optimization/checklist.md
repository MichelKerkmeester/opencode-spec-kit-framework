<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md [Evidence: spec.md exists at Level 3 with all required sections including Executive Summary, Risk Matrix, and User Stories]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md [Evidence: plan.md exists at Level 3 with phases, dependency graph, and ADR summary]
- [ ] CHK-003 [P1] Copilot model string `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5` verified as valid
- [ ] CHK-004 [P1] Baseline Context Packages saved (3-5 per mode: quick, medium, thorough)

<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

## Implementation

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] `.opencode/agent/context.md` model field updated to Haiku [Evidence: frontmatter line 5 changed from `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5` to `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5`]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] `.claude/agents/context.md` model field updated to `haiku` [Evidence: frontmatter line 5 changed from `sonnet` to `haiku`]
- [x] CHK-012 [P0] No changes to agent body content (instructions unchanged) [Evidence: only frontmatter model field modified in both files, agent body content identical]
- [ ] CHK-013 [P1] Both agent files pass YAML frontmatter validation

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [ ] CHK-020 [P0] Quick mode test: Context Package has all 6 sections, within 15-line limit
- [ ] CHK-021 [P0] Medium mode test: Context Package has pattern analysis, within 60-line limit
- [ ] CHK-022 [P0] Thorough mode test: Context Package has gap detection, dispatch decisions, within 120-line limit
- [ ] CHK-023 [P1] Quality comparison: Haiku outputs vs Sonnet baselines show no significant degradation
- [ ] CHK-024 [P1] Evidence citations present in all findings (`file:line` or memory ID)

<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

## Rollback Readiness

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] Rollback procedure verified (can revert in <1 minute) [Evidence: rollback requires reverting only 2 frontmatter lines in 2 files, <30 seconds]
- [x] CHK-031 [P1] Decision criteria documented: when to trigger rollback vs Option C fallback [Evidence: plan.md Phase 3.5 contains decision criteria and monitoring thresholds]
- [x] CHK-032 [P2] Escalation path: Option C (hybrid) implementation approach documented in plan.md [Evidence: plan.md Option C documents hybrid Haiku/Sonnet mode-specific routing]

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [ ] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/checklist synchronized and consistent
- [ ] CHK-041 [P2] Findings saved to memory/ for future reference

<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:arch-verify -->
## Architecture Verification

- [x] CHK-100 [P0] Model topology change verified: @context Sonnet → Haiku in both platforms [Evidence: .opencode/agent/context.md changed to `github-copilot/claude-haiku-4.5`, .claude/agents/context.md changed to `haiku`]
- [ ] CHK-101 [P1] Sub-agent model inheritance confirmed: @explore inherits Haiku, @research stays Opus
- [x] CHK-102 [P1] No unintended model changes to other agents (orchestrate, research, debug, review, write, speckit, handover) [Evidence: only context.md modified, no changes to other agent files]
- [ ] CHK-103 [P2] Architecture decision record (ADR-001) approved and status updated from "Proposed" to "Accepted"

<!-- /ANCHOR:arch-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:perf-verify -->
## Performance Verification

- [ ] CHK-110 [P0] Haiku Context Package latency is equal or better than Sonnet baseline
- [ ] CHK-111 [P1] Quick mode: tool call count within expected range (2-4 calls)
- [ ] CHK-112 [P1] Medium mode: tool call count within expected range (5-10 calls)
- [ ] CHK-113 [P1] Thorough mode: gap detection identifies >=80% of known gaps vs Sonnet baseline

<!-- /ANCHOR:perf-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->
## Deployment Readiness

- [ ] CHK-120 [P0] Both agent files committed to version control on dedicated branch
- [ ] CHK-121 [P0] Rollback branch or commit hash documented for instant revert
- [ ] CHK-122 [P1] Trial period defined (recommended: 1-2 weeks) with monitoring criteria
- [ ] CHK-123 [P1] Success/failure decision criteria documented with measurable thresholds
- [ ] CHK-124 [P2] Option C (hybrid) implementation path pre-built for rapid fallback activation

<!-- /ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->
## Compliance Verification

- [x] CHK-130 [P0] Agent routing rules in AGENTS.md unchanged — @context remains Priority 1 for exploration [Evidence: AGENTS.md not modified, routing logic unchanged]
- [ ] CHK-131 [P1] Orchestrator dispatch rules in orchestrate.md unchanged — thoroughness triggers preserved
- [ ] CHK-132 [P1] Context Window Budget (CWB) compliance maintained — output size limits per mode enforced
- [ ] CHK-133 [P2] Copilot premium request multiplier confirmed at 0.33x for Haiku (vs 1.0x Sonnet)

<!-- /ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs-verify -->
## Documentation Verification

- [x] CHK-140 [P0] spec.md at Level 3 with all required sections (Executive Summary, Risk Matrix, User Stories, Complexity Assessment) [Evidence: spec.md contains all Level 3 sections with complete content]
- [x] CHK-141 [P0] plan.md at Level 3 with all required sections (Dependency Graph, Critical Path, Milestones, ADR summary) [Evidence: plan.md contains all Level 3 sections including dependency graph, critical path, and ADR summary]
- [x] CHK-142 [P1] decision-record.md contains ADR-001 and ADR-002 with Five Checks evaluations [Evidence: decision-record.md contains ADR-001 (Haiku adoption) and ADR-002 (hybrid fallback) with complete Five Checks]
- [ ] CHK-143 [P1] Memory context saved and indexed for future retrieval
