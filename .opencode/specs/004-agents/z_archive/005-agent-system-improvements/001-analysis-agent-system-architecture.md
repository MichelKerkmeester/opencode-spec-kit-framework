## Executive Summary

Deep analysis of the current OpenCode system reveals it's already well-architected with sophisticated patterns (circuit breaker, saga compensation, 6-tier memory). The main gaps are documentation clarity (missing diagrams, verification sections) rather than architectural deficiencies.

**Key Finding**: Your system already implements 2026 industry best practices. Improvements are refinements, not overhauls.

## 2. Agent Quality Assessment

| Agent | Lines | Quality | Notes |
|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| research | 722 | 95/100 | Model agent - comprehensive verification |
| review | 800 | 94/100 | Excellent evidence grading |
| debug | 626 | 93/100 | Strong fresh perspective protocol |
| write | 831 | 90/100 | Good DQI integration |
| orchestrate | 887 | 85/100 | Feature-rich but missing OUTPUT VERIFICATION |
| handover | 339 | 75/100 | Adequate but thin anti-patterns |
| speckit | 466 | 72/100 | **Missing OUTPUT VERIFICATION section** |

### Best Patterns (From Strong Agents)

1. **Evidence Quality Rubric** (research.md) - Grade A-F with examples
2. **Self-Review Checklist** (research.md) - 10 items before completion
3. **Anti-Pattern Examples** (review.md) - BAD/GOOD code comparisons
4. **Tool Routing Tables** (debug.md) - Primary Tool + Fallback columns
5. **Structured Output Formats** (all) - JSON with STATUS=OK/FAIL

### Gaps Identified

| Gap | Agent | Impact |
|-----|-------|--------|
| Missing OUTPUT VERIFICATION | speckit, orchestrate | High - allows false completions |
| Thin anti-patterns | handover | Medium |
| No tool routing table | handover | Low |
| @write vs @documentation-writer | orchestrate | Medium - causes confusion |

## 3. Command Quality Assessment

| Domain | Commands | Quality | Issues |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| spec_kit | 7 commands | A | Minor: Q5/Q6 numbering in research.md |
| memory | 4 commands | A | None |

**All 11 commands are high quality.** Consistent patterns:
- Consolidated prompt format with BLOCKED status
- Violation self-detection sections
- Phase status verification tables
- MCP enforcement matrices (memory commands)

<!-- ANCHOR:skill-quality-assessment -->
## 4. Skill Quality Assessment

| Skill | Quality | Model To Follow? |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| workflows-code | Best | Yes - cleanest structure |
| system-spec-kit | Good | No - description too long |
| sk-documentation | Good | No - has redundant closing |

**workflows-code is the model** because:
- Concise 15-word description (vs 48 words)
- Clean phase-based organization (Phases 0-3)
- Unique "WHERE AM I?" self-orientation section
- No redundant closing "Remember" paragraph

## 5. Online Research Findings

### Patterns Worth Adopting (Simple, Documentation-Based)

| Pattern | Source | Applicability |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| "Never Touch" file list | GitHub AGENTS.md study | HIGH - immediate win |
| Code examples over prose | GitHub AGENTS.md study | HIGH - reduces ambiguity |
| Uncertainty permission | Anthropic hallucination research | HIGH - reduces false claims |
| Explicit task boundaries | Anthropic multi-agent research | MEDIUM |
| Scaling heuristics | Anthropic (50-agent over-spawn) | MEDIUM |
| Source quality ranking | Anthropic research | LOW |

### Patterns To Avoid

| Pattern | Why Skip | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Blackboard/Arbiter model | Coordination overhead | AWS patterns |
| Magentic orchestration | For open-ended problems only | Microsoft |
| Group Chat (3+ agents) | Control difficulty | Microsoft |
| Dynamic agent generation | Unpredictability | AWS |
| Decentralized planning | Coordination chaos | SuperAnnotate |

## 6. Prompt Engineering Insights

### Techniques That Improve Reliability

| Technique | Impact | Current State |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| XML tags for structure | High | Not used consistently |
| Uncertainty permission | High | Partial (confidence framework) |
| Few-shot examples | High | Missing from gates |
| Self-verification checkpoints | High | In some agents, not all |
| Front-loaded constraints | Medium | Already good |

### Anti-Patterns Found in Literature

| Anti-Pattern | Risk | Our Status |
|--------------|------|------------|
| Vague instructions | Assumptions fill gaps | Good - explicit |
| No escape hatch | Forces hallucination | Partial - add permission |
| Missing constraints | Over-delivery | Good - scope lock |
| Long paragraphs | Buried instructions | Some concern in AGENTS.md |
| No verification step | Errors propagate | Gap in 2 agents |

## 7. Naming Convention Analysis

### Current State

| Category | Pattern | Consistency |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Agents | lowercase single words | Good (except @write confusion) |
| Commands | `domain:action` | Good |
| Skills | `{prefix}-{name}` | Intentional (system/workflows/mcp) |

### Only Significant Issue

**@documentation-writer vs @write**:
- orchestrate.md uses `@documentation-writer` (4 locations)
- Everywhere else uses `@write`
- File is named `write.md`

**Fix**: Change orchestrate.md to use `@write` consistently.

<!-- ANCHOR:mermaid-diagram-analysis -->
## 8. Mermaid Diagram Analysis

### Current State: No visual workflows

### Research-Designed Diagrams Ready

1. **complete.md workflow** - 14-step flow with gates and conditional paths
2. **orchestrate.md core workflow** - 9-step delegation flow
3. **Agent routing decision tree** - Task type to agent mapping
4. **Failure handling protocol** - Retry/Reassign/Escalate visualization

### Style Guidelines Established

| Purpose | Shape | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Start/End | Stadium | `([START])` |
| Process | Rectangle | `[Step 1]` |
| Decision | Diamond | `{Pass?}` |
| Gate | Double Diamond | `{{GATE}}` |
| Phase | Subgraph | Container |

<!-- ANCHOR:conclusion -->
## 10. Conclusion

**Your system is architecturally sound.** The improvements needed are:
1. Documentation clarity (Mermaid diagrams)
2. Consistency fixes (naming, verification sections)
3. Missing OUTPUT VERIFICATION in 2 agents

**Scope**: Agent files (.opencode/agent/), command files (.opencode/command/), skill files (.opencode/skill/). AGENTS.md is out of scope.

**No new agents, systems, or major restructuring required.**
