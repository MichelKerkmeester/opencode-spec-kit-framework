# Spec: @write Agent Enforcement for /create Commands

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## Overview

Enforce `@write` agent requirement for all `/create` commands to ensure template-first workflow, DQI scoring, and quality gates are consistently applied.

## Problem Statement

The 5 `/create` commands in `.opencode/command/create/` lack enforcement of the `@write` agent requirement. This means:
- Commands can be executed without proper template loading
- DQI scoring may not be applied
- Quality gates from sk-documentation skill may be bypassed

<!-- /ANCHOR:problem-statement -->


<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## Scope

### In Scope
- Add PHASE 0: WRITE AGENT VERIFICATION to all 5 commands
- Update Phase Status Verification tables
- Update Violation Self-Detection sections
- Fix emoji inconsistencies per command_template.md Section 6
- Sync changes to public repo

### Out of Scope
- Changes to YAML workflow files
- Changes to command_template.md internal inconsistencies
- New command creation
