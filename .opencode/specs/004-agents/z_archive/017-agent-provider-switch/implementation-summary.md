## What Was Built

Implemented agent provider switching system enabling runtime toggle between Copilot and ChatGPT profiles while preserving `.opencode/agent/*.md` as the canonical runtime path.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/agent/scripts/activate-provider.sh` | Created | Provider activation with backup, verification, and rollback |
| `.opencode/agent/scripts/provider-status.sh` | Created | Status reporting and runtime health checks |
| `.opencode/agent/copilot/*.md` | Created | Copilot-specific agent profile files (8 files) |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md` | Created | ChatGPT-specific agent profile files (8 files) |
| `.opencode/README.md` | Modified | Documented activation and status workflow |
| `.opencode/skill/scripts/README.md` | Modified | Added operator command reference |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep `.opencode/agent/*.md` as primary runtime path | Preserve compatibility with existing commands and references |
| Use `copilot` and `chatgpt` profile names | Match actual operator intent and platform usage |
| Use copy + verify + rollback activation flow | Deterministic and safer than symlink-based switching |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Dry-run | Pass | Activation script validates provider existence and profile health |
| Two-way switch | Pass | `copilot -> chatgpt -> copilot` round-trip successful with clean activation |
| Induced mismatch rollback | Pass | Verification failure exits 5 with `ERROR: Verification failed for write.md`, `ROLLBACK_RUNTIME_MATCH=YES` confirms restore |
| Status check | Pass | `provider-status.sh` reports `copilot 8/8 MATCH` after successful activation |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- Optional enhancements remain: launch wrappers (`opencode-copilot`, `opencode-chatgpt`), active provider marker file, automated CI drift detection (P2 items CHK-020 through CHK-022).
