# Plan: Agent Architecture Analysis

<!-- ANCHOR:approach -->
## Approach
Multi-agent parallel research using 5 specialized analysis agents:

### Phase 1: Parallel Research (5 agents)
1. **Agent Architecture Analyzer** - Deep dive into oh-my-opencode agent implementations
2. **Communication Patterns Analyzer** - Focus on delegation and inter-agent communication
3. **Environment Auditor** - Analyze current AGENTS.md, skills, and capabilities
4. **Best Practices Researcher** - Research multi-agent patterns and best practices
5. **Recommendations Synthesizer** - Create recommendations and orchestrator refinements

### Phase 2: Synthesis
- Consolidate findings into analysis.md
- Create recommendations.md with prioritized agent list
- Propose orchestrator refinements

## Timeline
- Research: Parallel execution
- Synthesis: Sequential after research complete

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## Risks
- GitHub content may require multiple fetch attempts
- Agent patterns may not directly apply to Webflow context
- Mitigation: Adapt patterns to specific environment needs
