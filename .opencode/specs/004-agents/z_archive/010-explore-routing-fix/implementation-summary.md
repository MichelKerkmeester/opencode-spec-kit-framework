## What Was Built

Fixed two agent routing problems in `orchestrate.md` that caused the orchestrator to (1) dispatch @explore directly instead of routing through @context, and (2) dispatch custom agents without loading their actual agent definitions. The fix applied a "Promote @context, Demote @explore" strategy across 12 text edits in 4 phases to eliminate the "Pink Elephant Problem" (negative framing paradoxically reinforcing the unwanted behavior), and added a new Agent Loading Protocol ensuring all 7 custom agents are properly instantiated with their definition files before dispatch.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md` | Modified | All 12 edits: @explore salience reduction, @context promotion, Agent Loading Protocol |

<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Positive reframing over negative prohibition | "Route through @context" is more effective than "Never use @explore" because negative framing paradoxically increases @explore's salience in LLM attention (Pink Elephant Problem) |
| Remove @explore name entirely (0 mentions) | Exceeded the <=2 target because complete removal proved feasible without information loss; the orchestrator does not need to know internal sub-agent names |
| Structural enforcement at dispatch point (section 10) | Placing the `subagent_type: "general"` constraint at the exact point where the LLM writes dispatch calls is more effective than rules in a separate section |
| Agent Loading Protocol as mandatory 3-step process | READ file, INCLUDE in prompt, SET subagent_type "general" -- prevents improvised agent instructions that lose specialized templates, rules, and quality standards |
| Phase 4 added mid-implementation | The @speckit routing failure discovered during implementation revealed a systemic gap affecting all 7 custom agents, warranting immediate inclusion rather than a separate spec |
| Single file scope | All changes confined to orchestrate.md; AGENTS.md section 7 updates deferred to follow-up spec to maintain scope discipline |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual text inspection | Pass | All 12 edits verified against acceptance criteria in tasks.md |
| @explore mention count | Pass | Reduced from ~5 to 0 (target was <=2); one benign verb "Explore" remains in example task title |
| Markdown formatting | Pass | All modified tables, sections, and cross-references validated |
| Behavioral preservation | Pass | No routing logic changed; only text/framing modifications |
| Post-implementation observation | Pending | T6: Requires 3-5 sessions of real usage (P2 deferred) |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **System tool description immutable (RC-2)** -- The Task tool's built-in description still advertises `subagent_type: "explore"` with attractive language. This cannot be modified from agent definition files. Structural enforcement at the dispatch point (section 10) acts as the secondary barrier.
2. **AGENTS.md still references @explore** -- Section 7 of AGENTS.md contains similar @explore references that were not updated (out of scope). Requires a follow-up spec applying the same "promote @context" strategy.
3. **Post-implementation verification incomplete** -- T6 requires observing orchestrator behavior across 3-5 real sessions. Cannot be verified within a single implementation session.
4. **context.md agent load capacity** -- With increased routing through @context, the agent may need strengthening for higher traffic. Currently assessed as low risk but should be monitored.

## Deviations from Plan

| Planned | Actual | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| 8 changes across 3 phases | 12 edits across 4 phases | Phase 4 (Agent Loading Protocol) added after discovering @speckit routing failure during implementation |
| @explore mentions <=2 | @explore mentions = 0 | Complete elimination proved feasible and more effective than the conservative target |
| 35-40 minutes estimated | ~60 minutes actual | Phase 4 discovery and implementation added ~20 minutes |

### P2 Items (Deferred) -- 0/6

| ID | Description | Status | Deferral Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| CHK-100 | 3+ sessions observed post-fix | [ ] | Requires real usage over time (T6) |
| CHK-101 | Zero direct @explore dispatches observed | [ ] | Depends on CHK-100 |

---

## L2: VERIFICATION EVIDENCE

### Text Quality Evidence
- **@explore count**: `grep -c "@explore" orchestrate.md` -> 0 (down from ~5)
- **Markdown lint**: All tables, headers, and sections pass format validation
- **Section numbering**: Sequential, no gaps or duplicates introduced

### Behavioral Preservation Evidence
- **Agent routing table**: All 9 agents present and routable (verified by inspection)
- **Rule semantics**: Rule 4 intent preserved (all exploration must go through @context)
- **Dispatch format**: Template structure unchanged; only added constraint fields

### Structural Enforcement Evidence
- **Section 10**: subagent_type constraint visible at dispatch point -- "MUST be general"
- **Section 3**: subagent_type column shows "general" for every agent row
- **Section 3**: Agent Loading Protocol with 3-step mandatory process
- **Section 10 PDR**: "Agent Def" check with loaded/built-in/prior-session states

## L2: DEFERRED ITEMS

| Item | Reason | Follow-up |
|------|--------|-----------|
| T6: Post-implementation observation | Requires 3-5 real sessions over time | Monitor during normal orchestrator usage; document results |
| AGENTS.md section 7 updates | Out of scope (separate file) | Create follow-up spec applying same "promote @context" strategy |
| context.md load capacity review | Low risk, no immediate signal | Evaluate if @context shows performance issues after routing increase |
| CHK-100 through CHK-105 | P2 items requiring elapsed time | Complete during post-implementation observation period |
