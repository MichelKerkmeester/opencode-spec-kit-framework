<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## 1. What Was Done

Full audit of all agent files (8) and command files (38+) for `@explore` references that should be replaced with `@context_loader`. Applied the aggressive enforcement rule defined in spec.md §3.

<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## 2. Finding: Already Clean

**The codebase is already aggressively enforced.** An intermediate session (between spec 007 completion and this audit) had already:

1. Replaced the 9 "intentional" @explore references in orchestrate.md
2. Added **Rule 4: Never Dispatch @explore Directly** to orchestrate.md
3. Updated the Agent Selection Matrix with enforcement warnings
4. Added Two-Tier Model enforcement language

## 3. Audit Results

| Area | Files Scanned | Total Matches | Replacements Needed |
|------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Agent files (excl. context_loader.md) | 8 | 12 | 0 |
| Command files (.claude/commands/ + .opencode/command/) | 38+ | 113 | 0 |
| **Total** | **46+** | **125** | **0** |

### Categories of Remaining "explore" References (All Legitimate)

| Category | Count | Example | Why Legitimate |
|----------|-------|---------|---------------|
| Enforcement warnings | 7 | "NEVER dispatch @explore directly" | Promotes @context_loader |
| Factual built-in description | 3 | `subagent_type: "explore"` table entry | Documents the tool |
| Two-Tier Model description | 2 | "@context_loader dispatches @explore" | Internal mechanism |
| Task tool YAML params | 4 | `subagent_type: explore` | Literal code value |
| Role/name labels in YAML | 52 | `role: "architecture_explorer"` | Descriptive label |
| Natural English verb | 57 | "Explore the codebase", "Explored alternatives?" | Not an agent reference |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## 4. Current Enforcement State

orchestrate.md now has a 3-layer enforcement:

1. **Rule 4** (line 202): Explicit section "Never Dispatch @explore Directly"
2. **Agent Selection Matrix** (line 151): "REQUIRED — never dispatch @explore directly"
3. **Built-in Subagent Types table** (line 130): "Use @context_loader instead" warning

<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

## 5. Files Modified

None. The audit confirmed the codebase is already clean. Only spec folder documentation was created.

## 6. Conclusion

The aggressive enforcement objective was already achieved prior to this audit. This spec folder serves as the **verification record** confirming comprehensive coverage across all agents and commands.
