## What Was Built

Audited all 18 create command files (12 YAML workflows + 6 MD references) and updated them to comply with AGENTS.md routing rules. Three violations were fixed: spec folder creation now routes through @speckit (Rule 5), codebase discovery routes through @context (Rule 4), and all create commands have @review quality gates (§3).

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Scope reduced from 12 to 4 files for Phase 1+2 | Grep verified only 4 YAML files have spec_folder_setup / discovery steps |
| @review set to non-blocking | Create commands are generative — blocking on quality scores would frustrate users |
| Standardized 5-field agent_routing block | Consistency and AGENTS.md rule traceability across all 18 files |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Grep (inline patterns) | Pass | Zero matches for `Initialize spec.md`, `tool: Glob`, `tool: Grep` |
| Review Agent (Phase 1+2) | Pass | 72/72 structural checks passed |
| Review Agent (Phase 3) | Pass | 132/132 structural checks passed |
| Manual (MD files) | Pass | All 6 Agent Routing sections verified |

**Total**: 204/204 verification checks passed

## Changes by Phase

### Phase 1: @speckit Routing (4 YAML files)

Replaced inline `Write` calls for spec.md/plan.md with `agent_routing` dispatching @speckit. Outputs changed from `created_with_context` to `created_via_speckit`. Templates reference appropriate Level (Level 2 for skills, Level 1 for agents).

### Phase 2: @context Routing (4 YAML files)

Replaced inline `Glob`/`Grep` tool invocations with `agent_routing` dispatching @context for memory-first discovery. Activities now describe: dispatch → memory-first retrieval → Context Package return.

### Phase 3: @review Quality Gate (12 YAML + 6 MD files)

Added `quality_review` step to all 12 YAML files positioned before `save_context`. Auto files have no checkpoint; confirm files have 3-option checkpoint (Accept/View findings/Address issues). All use identical rubric: Accuracy 40%, Completeness 35%, Consistency 25%, threshold 70, non-blocking.

Added Agent Routing sections to all 6 MD reference files with step-agent-rule-purpose tables.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- Quality gate is advisory only (`blocking: false`) — low-quality artifacts can still be delivered without fixes
- Phase 1+2 changes only apply to skill and agent commands; future create commands should include @speckit/@context routing at creation time
