# Session Handover: JWT Authentication

**Spec Folder**: specs/042-jwt-authentication
**Created**: 2026-02-14 10:30
**Session Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Attempt**: 1

---

## 1. Session Summary

**Objective**: Plan JWT authentication feature
**Progress**: 100% (planning phase)

### Key Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive spec.md with P0/P1 requirements
- Designed plan.md with 3-phase implementation approach
- Created tasks.md with 14 tasks across Setup/Implementation/Verification
- Created checklist.md with 18 verification items
- Saved planning context to memory

---

## 2. Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | PLANNING (complete) |
| Active File | tasks.md |
| Last Action | Saved planning context to memory |
| System State | Ready for implementation |

---

## 3. Completed Work

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Request analysis - Feature scope defined
- [x] Pre-work review - NestJS patterns identified
- [x] Specification - spec.md created with all sections
- [x] Clarification - RS256 vs HS256 resolved
- [x] Planning - plan.md with 3 phases
- [x] Task breakdown - 14 tasks defined
- [x] Context saved - Memory file indexed

### Files Modified
- `spec.md` - Full L2 specification
- `plan.md` - Technical implementation plan
- `tasks.md` - 14 implementation tasks
- `checklist.md` - 18 verification items
- `memory/14-02-26_10-00__session.md` - Planning context

---

## 4. Pending Work

### Immediate Next Action
> Run /spec_kit:implement specs/042-jwt-authentication/ to begin Phase 1 setup

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] T001-T003 Setup phase (1-2 hours)
- [ ] T004-T010 Implementation phase (4-6 hours)
- [ ] T011-T014 Verification phase (2-3 hours)

---

## 5. Key Decisions

### JWT Algorithm Selection
- **Choice**: RS256
- **Rationale**: Asymmetric signing for distributed verification
- **Alternatives rejected**: HS256 (shared secret)

### Token Expiry Duration
- **Choice**: 15min access / 7d refresh
- **Rationale**: Industry standard security/UX balance

---

## 6. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None

### Risks
- Token secret exposure → Mitigation: Environment variables, key rotation
- Brute force attacks → Mitigation: Rate limiting on login endpoint

---

## 7. Continuation Instructions

### To Resume
```
/spec_kit:resume specs/042-jwt-authentication/
```

### Files to Review First
1. `tasks.md` - Review task list and dependencies
2. `plan.md` - Phase 2 implementation details
3. `spec.md` - Requirements for acceptance criteria

### Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Load this handover document
- [ ] Review pending tasks above
- [ ] Check tasks.md for current state
- [ ] Execute: /spec_kit:implement specs/042-jwt-authentication/
