## Research Summary

Comprehensive research on GraphQL API layer architecture for a greenfield microservices platform. The investigation covered federation patterns, schema design strategies, N+1 query prevention, and performance optimization.

**Greenfield Context**: This is a new system with no existing codebase. All architectural decisions are unconstrained by legacy patterns. The research provides foundational technical direction for the entire platform.

**Key Findings**:
1. Apollo Federation v2 is the production standard for composing microservice GraphQL APIs into a unified supergraph
2. Code-first schema generation with NestJS eliminates schema-code drift and provides compile-time type safety
3. DataLoader is essential for preventing N+1 queries in GraphQL resolvers
4. Apollo Router (Rust-based) provides 10x performance improvement over the JavaScript Apollo Gateway

**Feasibility**: HIGH - All required libraries are production-ready with extensive documentation and community support.

**Recommended Architecture**: Apollo Router (gateway) + NestJS code-first subgraphs + DataLoader + Apollo Federation v2

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Apollo Federation v2 over Schema Stitching
- **Choice**: Apollo Federation v2
- **Rationale**: Federation provides entity resolution across service boundaries via @key directives, enabling true domain-driven service ownership. Schema stitching becomes unwieldy beyond 5 services and lacks Federation's query planning capabilities.
- **Trade-off**: Vendor dependency on Apollo ecosystem, but the core spec (Federation v2) is open and supported by multiple implementations.

### Decision 2: Code-First over Schema-First
- **Choice**: NestJS @nestjs/graphql with code-first (TypeGraphQL decorators)
- **Rationale**: Single source of truth in TypeScript classes. Schema is auto-generated, eliminating drift. Compile-time type checking catches errors before runtime. NestJS DI integrates naturally.
- **Trade-off**: Schema is derived rather than designed upfront. Mitigated by generating SDL for review before deployment.

### Decision 3: Apollo Router over Apollo Gateway (JS)
- **Choice**: Apollo Router (Rust binary)
- **Rationale**: 10x performance improvement, lower resource usage, production-grade query planning. Netflix and other large companies use it in production.
- **Trade-off**: Less familiar Rust ecosystem for custom plugins. Mitigated by Rhai scripting support for common customizations.

### Greenfield Project Notes
- No existing codebase constraints or migration requirements
- Architecture designed from scratch for horizontal scalability
- Each subgraph is an independent NestJS service with its own database
- Future services can be added incrementally without affecting existing subgraphs

## Greenfield Architecture Notes

Since this is a greenfield project, the following baseline architecture decisions are established by this research:

- **Service framework**: NestJS (TypeScript) for all microservices
- **API layer**: GraphQL via Apollo Federation v2
- **Gateway**: Apollo Router (Rust)
- **Database strategy**: Polyglot persistence (PostgreSQL for relational, MongoDB for document-oriented)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, validated at both router and subgraph levels
- **Deployment target**: Kubernetes (inferred from service discovery patterns)

**Initial Subgraph Breakdown** (to be refined during planning):
1. Users subgraph - user management, authentication
2. Orders subgraph - order processing, payment integration
3. Products subgraph - catalog management, inventory

**No existing codebase patterns to integrate with** - all patterns established fresh by this research and the subsequent plan phase.
