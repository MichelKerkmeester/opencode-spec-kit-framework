## What Was Built

Implemented JWT-based authentication for the NestJS application. Encountered a blocking issue on T004 (JwtService) where ConfigService async initialization caused key loading to fail 3 times. After delegating to @debug agent, root cause was identified and fixed by moving key loading to onModuleInit lifecycle hook. All 14 tasks completed successfully after debug resolution.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| src/auth/jwt.service.ts | Created | JWT token generation, validation, and refresh (with onModuleInit fix) |
| src/auth/auth.controller.ts | Created | Login, logout, and token refresh HTTP endpoints |
| src/auth/auth.middleware.ts | Created | AuthGuard route protection middleware using Passport |
| src/auth/auth.module.ts | Created | Auth module configuration and dependency wiring |
| src/users/users.service.ts | Modified | Added password verification method with bcrypt |
| src/auth/jwt.service.spec.ts | Created | Unit tests for JwtService |
| test/auth.e2e-spec.ts | Created | Integration tests for auth flow |
| package.json | Modified | Added passport, @nestjs/jwt, bcrypt dependencies |
| config/keys/rsa-private.pem | Created | RSA private key for RS256 signing |
| config/keys/rsa-public.pem | Created | RSA public key for RS256 verification |

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| RS256 over HS256 | Asymmetric keys for better security posture |
| onModuleInit for key loading | Constructor-based loading caused race condition with ConfigService |
| bcrypt cost factor 12 | Balance of security and login response time |
| In-memory token blacklist | MVP scope; Redis deferred |

---

## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | Full auth cycle verified |
| Unit | Pass | 12 tests for JwtService |
| Integration | Pass | 8 e2e tests for auth flow |

### Checklist Verification

- Total items verified: 18/18
- P0 status: 8/8 complete
- P1 status: 8/8 complete
- P2 status: 2/2 complete
- Deferred P2 items: None
- See `checklist.md`

---

## Deviations from Plan

| Deviation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| T004 required debug delegation | ConfigService race condition not anticipated in planning |
| Key loading moved to onModuleInit | Constructor approach incompatible with async config resolution |

---

## Skill Updates

- No skill file updates required.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Redis-backed token blacklist for production
2. Monitoring alerts for auth failure rates
3. Feature flag for staged rollout
4. Consider registering JwtModule.registerAsync() for cleaner config

---

## Browser Testing Results

- Not applicable; backend-only API implementation.

---

## Known Limitations

- In-memory token blacklist does not persist across restarts
- Rate limiting is per-instance only
- Debug delegation added ~15 minutes to implementation timeline
