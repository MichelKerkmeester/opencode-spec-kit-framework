# Session Context: Notification System Complete Workflow

<!-- ANCHOR:GENERAL-SESSION-SUMMARY-042 -->
## Session Summary

**Spec Folder**: 042-notification-system
**Workflow**: /spec_kit:complete (autonomous mode)
**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Outcome**: All 14 steps completed successfully

Implemented a unified notification system with in-app alerts (WebSocket/Socket.IO) and email delivery (SendGrid). The system includes a central NotificationService, background EmailWorker with BullMQ, user preference management, and React UI components. All 20 tasks completed, all quality gates passed, all P0/P1 checklist items verified.

## Key Decisions

1. **Event-driven channel architecture**: Chose handler pattern for notification channels to allow easy extension (push, SMS) without modifying core dispatch logic.
2. **BullMQ over custom queue**: Leveraged BullMQ for email worker queue since Redis was already in the stack; provides built-in retry, backoff, and dead-letter support.
3. **Socket.IO over raw WebSocket**: Selected for built-in reconnection, room support, and automatic polling fallback.
4. **Consolidated API endpoints**: Merged mark-read and mark-all-read into a single PATCH endpoint with batch support (deviation from plan).
5. **SendGrid-only (no SMTP fallback)**: SendGrid reliability deemed sufficient; retry queue handles transient failures.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Central NotificationService dispatches to WebSocketChannel and EmailChannel
- User preferences filter which channels receive each event type
- EmailWorker processes queue asynchronously with 3x retry and exponential backoff
- Non-urgent emails batched into hourly digests

### Key Files
- src/services/notification-service.ts (dispatch orchestrator)
- src/services/email-service.ts (SendGrid integration)
- src/services/websocket-service.ts (real-time channel)
- src/workers/email-worker.ts (background processing)
- src/components/NotificationBell.tsx (UI)
- src/api/notifications.ts (REST endpoints)

### Test Coverage
- 22 unit tests, 10 integration tests, 6 component tests (all passing)
- Manual E2E: in-app delivery 1.2s, email delivery 34s
