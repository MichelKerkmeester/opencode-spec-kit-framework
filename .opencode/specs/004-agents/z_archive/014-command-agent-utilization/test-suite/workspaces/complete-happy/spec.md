# Feature Specification: Notification System with In-App Alerts and Email Delivery

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core | v2.2 -->

---

## 1. METADATA

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Level** | 2 |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Status** | Complete |
| **Created** | 2026-02-14 |
| **Branch** | `042-notification-system` |

---

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Users currently have no way to receive timely updates about system events, resulting in missed deadlines and poor engagement. There is no centralized notification mechanism for in-app alerts or email delivery, forcing manual communication for every status change.

### Purpose
Implement a unified notification system that delivers in-app alerts and email notifications to users based on configurable preferences, ensuring timely awareness of relevant system events.

---

## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- In-app notification bell with unread count badge
- Real-time in-app alert delivery via WebSocket
- Email notification delivery via SMTP (SendGrid integration)
- User notification preference management (per-channel, per-event-type)
- Notification persistence and read/unread state tracking
- Notification grouping and batching for email digest

### Out of Scope
- Push notifications (mobile) - deferred to Phase 2
- SMS notifications - cost constraints
- Notification analytics dashboard - separate feature request

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| src/services/notification-service.ts | Create | Core notification dispatch logic |
| src/services/email-service.ts | Create | Email delivery via SendGrid |
| src/services/websocket-service.ts | Modify | Add notification channel support |
| src/models/notification.ts | Create | Notification data model and types |
| src/models/notification-preference.ts | Create | User preference model |
| src/api/notifications.ts | Create | REST API endpoints for notifications |
| src/components/NotificationBell.tsx | Create | In-app notification UI component |
| src/components/NotificationPanel.tsx | Create | Notification list panel |
| src/migrations/20260214_notifications.sql | Create | Database schema for notifications |
| src/workers/email-worker.ts | Create | Background email processing worker |
| tests/notification-service.test.ts | Create | Unit tests for notification service |
| tests/email-service.test.ts | Create | Unit tests for email service |

## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | Notification service can create and persist notifications | A notification record is created in the database with correct payload, recipient, and timestamp |
| REQ-002 | In-app alerts delivered in real-time via WebSocket | Connected users see notifications within 2 seconds of dispatch without page refresh |
| REQ-003 | Email notifications delivered via SendGrid | Emails arrive in recipient inbox within 60 seconds; delivery status tracked |
| REQ-004 | Notifications have read/unread state | Users can mark notifications as read; unread count updates in real-time |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-005 | User notification preferences configurable | Users can enable/disable notifications per channel (in-app, email) and per event type |
| REQ-006 | Email digest batching for non-urgent notifications | Non-urgent emails grouped into hourly digest; urgent emails sent immediately |
| REQ-007 | Notification grouping for repeated events | Similar notifications within 5-minute window grouped with count badge |

---

## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: In-app notifications delivered to connected users within 2 seconds of event trigger (p95)
- **SC-002**: Email notifications queued and sent within 60 seconds for urgent, batched hourly for non-urgent
- **SC-003**: Users can configure per-channel, per-event-type preferences with changes taking effect immediately
- **SC-004**: Notification bell displays accurate unread count, updating in real-time across browser tabs

---

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | SendGrid API | Email delivery blocked if API unavailable | Implement retry queue with exponential backoff; fallback to SMTP relay |
| Dependency | WebSocket infrastructure | Real-time alerts require persistent connections | Graceful degradation to polling; reconnection logic with backoff |
| Risk | High notification volume | Database and email throughput bottleneck | Rate limiting per user; batching; async processing via worker queue |
| Risk | Email deliverability | Emails landing in spam folders | SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration; SendGrid reputation monitoring |

---

---

## L2: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: In-app notification delivery latency under 200ms p95 (server-side processing)
- **NFR-P02**: Email worker throughput of 500 emails/minute sustained

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Notification API endpoints require valid JWT authentication
- **NFR-S02**: Email content sanitized to prevent XSS in HTML emails; notification payloads validated against schema

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Notification service uptime target 99.9%; worker auto-restarts on crash
- **NFR-R02**: Failed email deliveries retried 3 times with exponential backoff before dead-lettering

---

## L2: EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty input: Notification with empty body rejected with 400 validation error
- Maximum length: Notification title capped at 200 chars, body at 2000 chars; excess truncated with ellipsis
- Invalid format: Malformed notification payloads return structured validation errors

### Error Scenarios
- External service failure: SendGrid outage triggers retry queue; in-app notifications unaffected
- Network timeout: WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s)
- Concurrent access: Optimistic locking on read/unread state; last-write-wins for preferences

### State Transitions
- Partial completion: Half-sent batch emails tracked; resume from last successful send
- Session expiry: Missed WebSocket notifications fetched via REST on reconnect

---

## L2: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Scope | 18/25 | 12 files, ~350 LOC, 3 systems (DB, WebSocket, Email) |
| Risk | 15/25 | External API dependency (SendGrid), real-time requirements |
| Research | 10/20 | SendGrid API well-documented; WebSocket patterns established |
| **Total** | **43/70** | **Level 2** |
