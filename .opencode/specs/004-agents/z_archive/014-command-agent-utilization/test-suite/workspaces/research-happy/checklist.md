# Verification Checklist: WebSocket Real-Time Collaboration Research

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

---

## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Research scope clearly defined - WebSocket-based real-time collaboration patterns for document editing
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Key research questions identified - 3 questions covering WebSocket library selection, conflict resolution strategy, and scaling patterns
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Codebase investigation completed - Existing REST controllers, TypeORM entities, JWT auth documented

---

## Research Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 17 research.md sections populated with substantive content
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No placeholder markers remaining ([YOUR_VALUE_HERE], [PLACEHOLDER])
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Sources cited for all major findings with URLs or code references
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Architecture diagram included and accurately represents recommended solution

---

## Technical Completeness

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Key question 1 answered: WebSocket library recommendation provided (ws via @nestjs/platform-ws)
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Key question 2 answered: Conflict resolution strategy defined (Yjs CRDT over OT)
- [x] CHK-022 [P0] Key question 3 answered: Scaling pattern documented (Redis pub/sub adapter)
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Alternative approaches documented with trade-offs
- [x] CHK-024 [P1] Risk assessment completed (CRDT complexity: medium, scaling: high)

---

## Feasibility Assessment

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] Feasibility rating provided (HIGH)
- [x] CHK-031 [P1] Performance benchmarks cited (50k connections per node, <50ms p95 latency)
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Security implications assessed (JWT auth, WSS encryption, input validation)

---

## Documentation Quality

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Code examples are syntactically correct TypeScript/JavaScript
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Implementation guide provides actionable guidance
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Troubleshooting guide covers common failure scenarios

---

## Context Preservation

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Memory file created with ANCHOR tags
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] Key decisions documented for future reference
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Implementation phases defined for handoff to plan workflow
