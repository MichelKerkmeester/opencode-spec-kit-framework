# Feature Specification: JWT Authentication

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core | v2.2 -->

---

## 1. METADATA

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Level** | 2 |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Status** | In Progress |
| **Created** | 2026-02-14 |
| **Branch** | `042-jwt-authentication` |

---

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The application currently lacks a secure authentication mechanism. Users cannot log in, and API endpoints are unprotected, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data and operations.

### Purpose
Implement JWT-based authentication to secure API endpoints and provide user login/logout functionality with token refresh capabilities.

---

## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- JWT token generation and validation
- User login/logout endpoints
- Token refresh mechanism
- Protected route middleware
- Password hashing with bcrypt

### Out of Scope
- OAuth2/social login - deferred to future sprint
- Multi-factor authentication - separate feature
- Role-based access control - depends on user roles feature

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| src/auth/jwt.service.ts | Create | JWT token generation and validation |
| src/auth/auth.controller.ts | Create | Login/logout/refresh endpoints |
| src/auth/auth.middleware.ts | Create | Route protection middleware |
| src/auth/auth.module.ts | Create | Auth module configuration |
| src/users/users.service.ts | Modify | Add password verification method |

---

## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | JWT token generation with configurable expiry | Token generated with RS256, expires in 15min |
| REQ-002 | Login endpoint validates credentials | POST /auth/login returns JWT on valid creds, 401 on invalid |
| REQ-003 | Protected route middleware | Middleware rejects requests without valid JWT |
| REQ-004 | Password hashing | Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes, never plaintext |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-005 | Token refresh endpoint | POST /auth/refresh extends session without re-login |
| REQ-006 | Logout with token invalidation | POST /auth/logout blacklists current token |

---

## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: All API endpoints return 401 for requests without valid JWT
- **SC-002**: Login flow completes in under 200ms p95
- **SC-003**: Token refresh works without user re-authentication

---

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Users service | Cannot auth without user lookup | Users service already exists |
| Risk | Token secret exposure | High - full auth bypass | Use env vars, rotate keys |
| Risk | Brute force attacks | Medium - account lockout | Rate limiting on login |

---

---

## L2: NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Login response time <200ms p95
- **NFR-P02**: Token validation <5ms per request

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: JWT signed with RS256 algorithm
- **NFR-S02**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Auth service 99.9% uptime
- **NFR-R02**: Graceful degradation on token service failure

---

## L2: EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty credentials: Return 400 Bad Request with validation errors
- Maximum password length: 128 characters, reject longer
- Invalid email format: Return 400 with specific field error

### Error Scenarios
- Database connection failure: Return 503 Service Unavailable
- Token signing failure: Log error, return 500
- Concurrent login attempts: Allow, each gets unique token

### State Transitions
- Expired token + valid refresh: Issue new access token
- Expired token + expired refresh: Require full re-login

---

## L2: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Scope | 15/25 | 5 files, ~300 LOC |
| Risk | 18/25 | Auth is security-critical |
| Research | 8/20 | JWT well-documented |
| **Total** | **41/70** | **Level 2** |

---

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

- Should we use RS256 or HS256 for JWT signing?
- What should the token expiry duration be? (suggested: 15min access, 7d refresh)
