# Session Handover Document

Session handover for cross-project implementation: Smart Agent Integration into Spec Kit Commands.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: handover | v1.0 -->
<!-- CONTINUATION - Attempt 1 -->

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

**Use handover.md when:**
- Ending a session with incomplete work that needs continuation
- Context needs to be preserved for a future session (same or different agent)
- Transitioning work between team members or AI sessions
- Complex multi-session features requiring state preservation
- Session compaction detected and recovery needed

**Status values:** Draft | In Progress | Review | Complete | Archived

- **To Session:** Next continuation session
- **Phase Completed:** IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- **Handover Time:** 2026-02-14

**Feature**: Smart Agent Integration into Spec Kit Commands

## 2. Context Transfer

### 2.1 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Dual-phase @review integration | Pre-Commit code review (Mode 2, advisory) + Gate Validation checklist check (Mode 4, blocking) provides comprehensive quality coverage | Affects implement.md and complete.md — both commands now invoke @review twice with different modes |
| @debug failure threshold (>= 3) | Mirrors complete.md's proven pattern — prevents premature debug dispatch while catching persistent issues | Affects implement.md Step 6 and complete.md Step 10 |
| @research dual trigger in plan.md | Dispatch on confidence < 60% OR user request ensures research happens when needed without blocking low-confidence planning | Affects plan.md Step 5 |
| resume.md and handover.md exclusion | These commands are meta-workflow tools that don't create artifacts requiring agent routing | Zero changes to resume.md and handover.md |

### 2.2 Blockers Encountered

| Blocker | Status | Resolution/Workaround |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| None encountered | N/A | Implementation completed without blockers |

## 3. For Next Session

### 3.1 Recommended Starting Point

- **File**: `.opencode/command/spec_kit/` (working directory)
- **Context**: Implementation is complete. All agent routing has been added to spec_kit commands. The work mirrors spec 014's pattern (create commands agent routing). Git commit is pending user request.

### 3.2 Priority Tasks Remaining

1. **Git commit** (if user requests) — All changes are uncommitted on branch `main`
2. **No implementation work remaining** — Phase marked COMPLETE with all verification passed
3. **Potential follow-up**: User may request testing of the updated workflows or documentation updates

### 3.3 Critical Context to Load

- [x] Spec file: `spec.md` from spec 014 (Command Agent Utilization Audit) — provides pattern foundation
- [x] Plan file: `plan.md` from spec 014 — shows phase structure used for create commands
- [x] This handover: Full context of what was implemented in this session

**Related Spec**: `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/specs/004-agents/014-command-agent-utilization`

---

## 4. Validation Checklist

Before handover, verify:
- [x] All in-progress work committed or stashed — **Changes are uncommitted but complete**
- [x] Memory file saved with current context — **Context captured in this handover**
- [x] No breaking changes left mid-implementation — **All 15 files complete**
- [x] Tests passing (if applicable) — **Verification completed: all routing entries confirmed**
- [x] This handover document is complete — **All placeholders replaced with actual values**

## 5. Session Notes

**Cross-Project Implementation Note**: This session worked in the "Opencode Env/Public" project to implement changes that are documented in spec folder 014 within the "anobel.com" project. This is a standard pattern for Opencode system-level improvements.

**Agent Routing Pattern Consistency**: The implementation successfully mirrored the create commands pattern from spec 014, extending the same routing logic to spec_kit commands. Key consistency points:
- @debug uses failure_count >= 3 threshold in both create and spec_kit commands
- @review uses dual-phase (Mode 2 + Mode 4) in code-writing workflows
- @handover appears in session-end steps across all applicable commands
- @research uses confidence scoring triggers consistently

**Verification Approach**: All changes were verified by checking:
1. Presence of agent routing blocks in modified .md files
2. Matching YAML workflow entries for each routed agent
3. Correct step numbers and trigger conditions
4. Consistency between auto and confirm mode files

**Git Status**: Branch `main`, 15 modified files, no commits made yet. User has not requested commit — this is intentional and compliant with the "never commit unless explicitly asked" rule.

**No Blockers**: Implementation completed smoothly with no technical issues, scope changes, or dependency problems.
