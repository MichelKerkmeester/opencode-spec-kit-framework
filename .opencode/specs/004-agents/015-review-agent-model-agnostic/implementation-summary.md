## What Was Built

Removed the hardcoded `model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6` line from the review agent's YAML frontmatter, enabling model inheritance from the dispatching parent agent. This follows the established pattern used by `orchestrate.md` (which has `mode: primary` and no `model:` field), ensuring the review sub-agent adapts to whatever model the invoking agent uses rather than being locked to a specific model.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/agent/review.md` | Modified | Removed line 5 (`model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6`) from YAML frontmatter |

### Files Investigated (No Changes Needed)

| File/Path | Scope | Finding |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/*.md` (7 files) | Command files | Zero model references for review agent |
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/*.yaml` (13 files) | YAML asset files | Contain `model: opus` for orchestrator dispatch modes, not review agent |
| `.opencode/agent/context.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/debug.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/research.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/handover.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/speckit.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/write.md` | Agent file | Own model config, unrelated to review |
| `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md` | Agent file | References "Haiku" in body for context agent quality notes, unrelated to review |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove `model:` field entirely (not replace with a different value) | Enables inheritance from dispatching parent agent, matching the `orchestrate.md` pattern |
| Scope limited to review agent only | Other agents have their own model configs for valid reasons; changing them is a separate concern |
| No changes to command/asset YAML files | The `model: opus` references in assets control orchestrator dispatch modes, not the review agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | YAML frontmatter validates correctly after line removal |
| Syntax | Pass | Frontmatter structure intact (name, description, mode, temperature, permission block) |
| Investigation | Pass | Comprehensive search of 20+ files confirmed no other review-model references require changes |
| Integration | Skip | Runtime dispatch testing deferred to manual usage (review agent will inherit model on next dispatch) |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Other agents still have hardcoded models** - context, debug, research, handover, speckit, and write agents each have their own `model:` field. Making them model-agnostic would be a separate spec if desired.
2. **No automated test for model inheritance** - Verification relies on manual dispatch; no CI test confirms the inheritance mechanism works correctly.
