## What Was Built

Completed two finalized workstreams under this spec: (1) the 8-file ChatGPT agent consistency pass, and (2) runtime-aware command path normalization across command markdown and YAML assets. This keeps the direct-first Codex orchestration profile while removing runtime-path drift in command generation and execution guidance.

### Runtime Path Mapping

- Default/Copilot runtime: `.opencode/agent`
- ChatGPT runtime: `.opencode/agent/chatgpt`
- Claude runtime: `/.claude/agents`

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/{context,debug,handover,research,review,speckit,write,orchestrate}.md` | Modified | Agent-suite consistency pass (fast-path semantics, completion rules, exception handling, direct-first orchestrate guardrails) |
| `.opencode/specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/{spec,plan,tasks,checklist,decision-record,implementation-summary}.md` | Modified | Spec scope, execution records, and evidence updated to include suite + command runtime-path work |
| `.opencode/command/create/*.md` | Modified | Added runtime path resolution sections so command behavior selects runtime-appropriate agent roots |
| `.opencode/command/create/assets/*.yaml` | Modified | Replaced hardcoded `agent_file` values with runtime-path placeholders and normalized lookup fields |
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/*.md` | Modified | Added runtime path resolution guidance for spec-kit command execution flows |
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/*.yaml` | Modified | Updated `agent_file` placeholder wiring for runtime-aware resolution |
| `.opencode/command/memory/continue.md` | Modified | Expanded mismatch detection to include all supported runtime agent paths |
| `.opencode/command/create/README.txt` | Modified | Added troubleshooting note for runtime-path mismatches and how to verify resolved paths |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Expand from single-file to suite-wide pass | Contradiction fixes require cross-agent consistency, not isolated edits |
| Normalize command runtime-path handling | Remove hardcoded agent path drift between Copilot, ChatGPT, and Claude runtimes |
| Use canonical runtime mapping in command docs/assets | Keep command markdown and YAML generation rules aligned to a single path model |
| Keep orchestrate direct-first + DEG profile | Prevent micro-task fan-out and unnecessary dispatch width |
| Align fast-path semantics across leaf agents | Reduce ambiguity about what can be skipped in low complexity mode |
| Align completion/validation semantics | Keep blocker/required/pass criteria deterministic across files |
| Preserve NDP and authority boundaries | Maintain depth and exclusivity guardrails while optimizing behavior |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Structural policy check | Pass | Codex-consistent wording present across all 8 ChatGPT files |
| Contradiction consistency check | Pass | Drift fixes verified for fast-path, completion, and exception semantics |
| Command diff scope check | Pass | `.opencode/command` diff: 33 files changed, 147 insertions, 71 deletions |
| YAML parse validation | Pass | 23 modified command YAML assets parsed successfully (`YAML_OK 23`) |
| Hardcoded path scan | Pass | No remaining `agent_file: ".opencode/agent/..."` matches in `.opencode/command` YAML assets |
| NDP integrity check | Pass | Max depth and LEAF constraints remain unchanged |
| Threshold consistency check | Pass | Orchestrate CWB/TCB/DEG values remain internally aligned |
| Spec validation | Pending run | Execute final `validate.sh --json` after documentation sync |

## Verification Steps Taken

1. Read all 8 ChatGPT agent files to identify contradiction and drift points.
2. Applied targeted consistency edits across context/debug/handover/research/review/speckit/write/orchestrate.
3. Updated command markdown in create/spec_kit areas with runtime path resolution sections.
4. Updated command YAML assets in create/spec_kit areas to use runtime-aware `agent_file` placeholders.
5. Verified command diff scope for runtime-path work: 33 files changed, 147 insertions, 71 deletions.
6. Ran YAML parse validation on modified command YAML assets: `YAML_OK 23`.
7. Ran pattern scan confirming no hardcoded `agent_file: ".opencode/agent/..."` values remain in command YAML assets.

<!-- ANCHOR:deviations -->
## Deviations From Plan

- Scope expanded from orchestrate-only to full ChatGPT suite by explicit user instruction.
- Scope expanded again to include command runtime-path normalization across command markdown and YAML assets.
- Verification now includes command diff scope, YAML parse evidence, and hardcoded-path scan results.

<!-- ANCHOR:skill-updates -->
## Skill Updates

- No skill files were modified.
- Workflow relied on system-spec-kit templates and validation scripts.
<!-- /ANCHOR:skill-updates -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:browser-testing -->
## Browser Testing Results

- Not applicable. Change set is documentation/policy only and has no browser runtime surface.
<!-- /ANCHOR:browser-testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:next-steps -->
## Recommended Next Steps

1. Run final `scripts/spec/validate.sh --json .opencode/specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate` after any remaining documentation sync.
2. Add a small regression check script to detect future hardcoded `agent_file` path regressions in command YAML assets.
<!-- /ANCHOR:next-steps -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- Enforcement remains instruction-based; there is no runtime guard to hard-stop over-decomposition.
- Threshold tuning is static and may need future iteration based on observed orchestration telemetry.
- Runtime-path correctness still depends on command-side resolution logic and placeholder substitution remaining in sync.
