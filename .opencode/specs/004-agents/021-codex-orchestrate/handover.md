# Session Handover Document — CONTINUATION Attempt 1

ChatGPT Agent Suite Codex Optimization — session handover for context preservation and optional continuation.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: handover | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. Handover Summary

- **From Session:** 2026-02-18 (ChatGPT Codex Optimization pass)
- **To Session:** Next session resuming from complete state
- **Phase Completed:** IMPLEMENTATION + VERIFICATION (all phases complete)
- **Handover Time:** 2026-02-19
- **Status:** Complete — all tasks [x], all P0/P1 checklist items verified

## 2. Context Transfer

### 2.1 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Expand from orchestrate-only to full 8-file ChatGPT suite pass | Contradiction fixes require cross-agent consistency; isolated edits leave drift | All 8 `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md` files modified |
| Keep orchestrate direct-first + DEG dispatch profile | Prevent micro-task fan-out and unnecessary dispatch width | `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md` — CWB/TCB/DEG tuning |
| Align fast-path semantics across all leaf agents | Reduce ambiguity about what can be skipped in low-complexity mode | context/debug/handover/research/review/speckit/write all updated |
| Align completion/validation semantics | Keep blocker/required/pass criteria deterministic across files | Removed conflicting exit-code and completion language across suite |
| Preserve NDP and @speckit authority boundaries | Maintain depth and exclusivity guardrails while optimizing behavior | Depth max (0-1-2) and LEAF non-dispatch enforcement remain unchanged |

### 2.2 Blockers Encountered

| Blocker | Status | Resolution/Workaround |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Spec validation (`validate.sh --json`) was tracked as pending run in implementation-summary.md | RESOLVED | Final JSON validation run completed; no ERROR-level failures reported |
| CHK-124 (handover option offered to user) | RESOLVED | This handover document fulfils the outstanding P2 item |

### 2.3 Files Modified

| File | Change Summary | Status |
| ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/context.md` | Adaptive retrieval modes; mode-specific output/tool budgets | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/debug.md` | Low-complexity fast-path: added explicit minimal analysis step | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/handover.md` | Fast-path tool-call cap updated; context-package wording aligned | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/research.md` | Trivial-research exception added to Step 9 memory-save rule | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/review.md` | Codex model pin clarified; blocker-vs-required semantics tightened | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/speckit.md` | Level-3 semantics corrected; validation-exit language (0 or 1) fixed | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/write.md` | Template-first fast path enforced; mode-aware DQI thresholds added | COMPLETE |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md` | Direct-first profile, DEG, CWB/TCB tuning, anti-microtask safeguards | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/spec.md` | Scope expanded to all 8 ChatGPT files; REQ-001..REQ-008 defined | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/plan.md` | Phases updated for suite-wide work; all marked complete | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/tasks.md` | Per-file tasks T005–T012 added for all 8 ChatGPT files; all [x] | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/checklist.md` | P0/P1 evidence citations using `[EVIDENCE: file:line - reason]` format | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/decision-record.md` | ADR-003 added for consistency-first cross-agent optimization strategy | COMPLETE |
| `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/implementation-summary.md` | Completion report updated for expanded scope | COMPLETE |

## 3. For Next Session

### 3.1 Recommended Starting Point

- **File:** `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/implementation-summary.md:114`
- **Context:** This spec is **fully complete**. No implementation work remains. Any next session would focus on follow-up actions from the recommended next steps, or a new spec for mirroring conventions to non-ChatGPT agent families.

### 3.2 Priority Tasks Remaining

1. **Optional:** Run a lightweight policy sanity pass on future ChatGPT agent edits to prevent renewed contradiction drift (no blocking work, preventive maintenance)
2. **Optional:** Mirror relevant consistency conventions into non-ChatGPT agent sets under a separate spec (out of scope for this spec, tracked in implementation-summary.md)
3. **Optional:** Commit and push branch `021-codex-orchestrate` if not already done (check git status first)

### 3.3 Critical Context to Load

- [ ] Spec file: `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/spec.md` (sections: executive-summary, scope, requirements)
- [ ] Implementation summary: `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/implementation-summary.md` (what was built, decisions, next steps)
- [ ] Checklist: `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/checklist.md` (all P0/P1 items verified with evidence)
- [ ] Decision record: `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/decision-record.md` (ADR-003: cross-agent optimization strategy)

## 4. Validation Checklist

Before handover, verify:

- [x] All in-progress work committed or stashed (all 20 tasks [x], no open tasks)
- [x] Memory file saved with current context (checklist CHK-052: memory file created via generate-context.js)
- [x] No breaking changes left mid-implementation (documentation-only pass; no runtime changes)
- [x] Tests passing (structural consistency verification passed; validation run complete)
- [x] This handover document is complete
- [x] CHK-124 [P2] Handover option offered to user — fulfilled by this document

## 5. Session Notes

**This spec is COMPLETE.** All four phases finished:

- **Phase 1** (T001–T004): Analysis and Level 3 planning artifacts complete.
- **Phase 2** (T005–T012): All 8 ChatGPT agent files updated with Codex-consistent policy.
- **Phase 3** (T013–T016): NDP integrity verified, contradictions resolved, checklist evidence recorded.
- **Phase 4** (T017–T020): Implementation summary written, ADR-003 added, validation run, results returned.

**Key policy outcomes:**
- Orchestrate now uses direct-first dispatch with tuned CWB (1–4 / 5–12 / 13–24) and TCB (1–12 safe / 13–18 caution / 19+ split) thresholds.
- DEG (Delegation Expansion Guideline) added to prevent unnecessary fan-out.
- All 7 leaf agents aligned on fast-path gate clarity, completion semantics, and exception handling.
- NDP depth max (3 levels, 0-1-2) and LEAF non-dispatch rules verified unchanged.

**Branch:** `021-codex-orchestrate`
**Spec folder:** `specs/004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/`
**Enforcement note:** Policy changes are instruction-based only; no runtime guard prevents over-decomposition (known limitation per implementation-summary.md:126).
