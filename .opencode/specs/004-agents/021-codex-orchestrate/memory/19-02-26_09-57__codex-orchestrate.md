<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**What Was Built**:

- **Executed fallback Option C for /memory:save after target-path policy blocked direct generation in...** - Executed fallback Option C for /memory:save after target-path policy blocked direct generation in the fe-creators-mobile repository.

**How to Extend**:

- Apply validation patterns to new input handling

**Common Patterns**:

- **Validation**: Input validation before processing

- **Graceful Fallback**: Provide sensible defaults when primary method fails

## 2. OVERVIEW

Executed fallback Option C for /memory:save after target-path policy blocked direct generation in the fe-creators-mobile repository. Generated conversation context in an allowed workspace using JSON mode, then copied the resulting memory file into the target spec folder memory directory for 007-keyboard-bg-fix. No app source files were modified; only memory-save artifacts were handled. Immediate indexing was attempted for the copied file and status is reported explicitly.

**Key Outcomes**:

Executed fallback Option C for /memory:save after target-path policy blocked direct generation in the fe-creators-mobile repository. Generated conversation context in an allowed workspace using JSON mode, then copied the resulting memory file into the target spec folder memory directory for 007-keyboard-bg-fix. No app source files were modified; only memory-save artifacts were handled. Immediate indexing was attempted for the copied file and status is reported explicitly.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 004-agents/021-codex-orchestrate --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
