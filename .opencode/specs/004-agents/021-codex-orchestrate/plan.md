# Implementation Plan: ChatGPT Agent Suite Codex Optimization

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | Markdown policy documents |
| **Framework** | OpenCode ChatGPT agent suite (`.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md`) |
| **Storage** | File-based: 8 ChatGPT agent files + Level 3 spec artifacts |
| **Testing** | Static consistency verification (read/grep + checklist evidence) |

### Overview
This implementation performs a suite-level audit and optimization pass across all 8 ChatGPT agent files. The work extends orchestrate optimization into consistency fixes for context/debug/handover/research/review/speckit/write so dispatch thresholds, fast-path semantics, and completion rules align without weakening NDP or agent-authority guardrails.

<!-- ANCHOR:ai-execution-protocol -->
## L3: AI EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Task Checklist
- [x] Scope target confirmed (all `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md` files)
- [x] Baseline content read before edits
- [x] Level 3 documentation files prepared before implementation

### Execution Rules

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Scope Lock | No adjacent cleanup outside declared target |
| Edit Safety | Preserve NDP safety constraints while editing nearby sections |
| Verification | Run consistency checks and spec validation before completion |
| Evidence | Record file:line evidence for all P0/P1 checklist completions |

### Status Reporting Format

`STEP [N]: [status] -> [artifact/result]`

### Blocked Task Protocol
1. Stop at first hard blocker.
2. Record blocker with exact file/line and attempted fix.
3. Provide fallback options and wait for user direction only when blocked.

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Policy-layer optimization and contradiction cleanup across the ChatGPT agent suite.

### Key Components
- **Orchestrate policy core**: direct-first, DEG, CWB/TCB threshold profile
- **Context retrieval profile**: adaptive quick/standard/deep retrieval modes
- **Completion semantics cleanup**: review/write/research/speckit consistency edits
- **Fast-path normalization**: debug/handover/research/write clarity on non-skippable gates
- **Authority guardrails**: preserve @speckit exclusivity and NDP/LEAF constraints

### Data Flow
User request -> orchestrator policy -> leaf agent behavior -> cross-agent consistency -> completion verification.

This plan changes documentation policy content in all 8 ChatGPT agent files, not runtime code or tool implementations.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Baseline Analysis
- [x] Read all 8 files in `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/`
- [x] Identify contradiction drift and inconsistency hotspots
- [x] Define suite-wide Codex optimization consistency targets

### Phase 2: Policy Implementation
- [x] Update `context.md` retrieval mode and output-budget rules
- [x] Update `debug.md` low-complexity fast path wording
- [x] Update `handover.md` fast path and context-package phrasing
- [x] Update `research.md` memory-save exception semantics
- [x] Update `review.md` model and blocker/required clarity
- [x] Update `speckit.md` level and validation semantics
- [x] Update `write.md` template-first and mode-aware DQI completion rules
- [x] Update `orchestrate.md` direct-first profile, DEG, CWB/TCB, and anti-patterns

### Phase 3: Verification
- [x] Verify NDP text remains intact
- [x] Verify contradiction fixes across all 8 agent files
- [x] Verify no stale threshold or completion wording remains
- [x] Complete checklist with evidence

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Structural review | Cross-agent section coherence and policy consistency | Read |
| Contradiction sweep | Conflicting thresholds/semantics removed | Grep + Read |
| Scope verification | Ensure all 8 intended ChatGPT files were covered | git status + diff |
| Safety verification | NDP and authority constraints unchanged | Read + checklist evidence |

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Existing NDP section in orchestrate file | Internal | Green | Optimization cannot proceed safely without preserving it |
| Existing policy text across 8 ChatGPT files | Internal | Green | Inconsistent edits would leave contradiction drift |
| Spec folder docs completeness (Level 3) | Process | Green | Workflow cannot complete without full artifact set |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: Updated suite policy causes contradictory guidance or user rejects optimization behavior
- **Procedure**: Revert affected `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md` files to prior revisions and keep spec docs as record

<!-- ANCHOR:enhanced-rollback -->
## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [x] Capture final diff for target file
- [x] Confirm no out-of-scope files are modified
- [x] Confirm checklist evidence is recorded

### Rollback Procedure
1. Revert modified `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/*.md` files to prior commit
2. Re-run consistency checks against restored files
3. Preserve spec folder documentation as implementation history

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No
- **Reversal procedure**: Not applicable (documentation-only change)

## L3: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

### ADR-001: Direct-First Delegation with Suite-Wide Consistency

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Orchestrate and sibling files diverged in thresholds and completion semantics.

**Decision**: Default to single-agent/focused execution in orchestrate and align sibling agent guidance to avoid contradictory execution behavior.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: fewer tiny tasks, less orchestration overhead.
- Negative: requires careful thresholds to avoid under-delegation for complex work.

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Keep current defaults and only raise one threshold: insufficient to solve root problem.
