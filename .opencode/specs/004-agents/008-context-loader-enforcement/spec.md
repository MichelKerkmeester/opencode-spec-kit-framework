<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## 1. Overview

Aggressively enforce `@context_loader` as the primary context retrieval agent across all agents and commands. The previous session (007) created @context_loader but was too conservative in replacing `@explore` references — 9 references in orchestrate.md were marked "intentional" when several should have been replaced.

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. Problem Statement

`@explore` references persist across the codebase in contexts where they **recommend routing or behavior**. These should point users/orchestrator to `@context_loader` instead. The built-in `subagent_type: "explore"` is a Task tool parameter — not an agent recommendation.

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 3. The Enforcement Rule

**@explore is ONLY acceptable when:**
1. Inside `@context_loader.md` itself (it dispatches the built-in @explore)
2. `subagent_type: "explore"` — literal Task tool parameter in YAML configs
3. Factual description of the built-in type ("The built-in explore subagent provides...")
4. Two-Tier Model description (where @context_loader dispatches @explore)
5. Comparative text that PROMOTES @context_loader ("Prefer @context_loader over raw @explore")
6. Built-in modes (Build & Plan) that reference explore as a system feature

**@explore must be REPLACED with @context_loader when:**
- Routing recommendations ("dispatch @explore for investigation")
- Example outputs (`[found by @explore]`)
- Agent selection templates/lists
- Reassignment examples
- Any place suggesting WHAT TO DO or WHO TO DISPATCH

## 4. Scope

### In Scope
- ALL agent files in `.opencode/agent/`
- ALL command files in `.claude/commands/` and `.opencode/command/`
- `orchestrate.md` — re-examine all 9 "intentional" @explore references
- Any other files with @explore routing recommendations

### Out of Scope
- `@context_loader.md` itself (it correctly references @explore as its dispatch target)
- AGENTS.md files (already updated in 007)
- Skill files (already audited clean in 007)
- Install guides (already updated in 007)
