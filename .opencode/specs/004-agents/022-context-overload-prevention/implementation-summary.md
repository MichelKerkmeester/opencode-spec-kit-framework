## What Was Built

The orchestrator agent now protects itself from context overload. Five new sections were added to all three runtime variants of orchestrate.md, giving the orchestrator explicit rules for managing its own context window instead of relying on implicit budgets that frequently failed under real workloads.

The additions came from a purpose-built prevention prompt (007-enhanced-cc-context-overload-prevention.md) that was developed earlier in the same session by analyzing all 8 agent definitions and the AGENTS.md runtime resolution logic.

### Additions Per Variant

| Section | Where Added | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Context Pressure Response Protocol** | Section 7 | 4-step sequence: pause dispatching, announce to user, wait for confirmation, fallback to handover |
| **Output Discipline** | Section 7 | Rules for summarizing large outputs, never echoing raw tool results |
| **Recovery Protocol** | Section 6 | What to do after compaction (Claude) or session degradation (Copilot/ChatGPT) |
| **Self-Protection Rules** | Section 8 | Targeted reads, no accumulation, write-don't-hold, batch calls |
| **Anti-patterns (3 new)** | Section 9 | Don't bulk-read, don't echo raw output, don't continue after degradation |

### Runtime Adaptations

| Dimension | Claude (~150K) | Copilot (~150K) | ChatGPT/Codex (~220K) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Pressure announcement | `/compact` | "save context" | "save context" |
| Recovery reads | CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md | AGENTS.md + project config | AGENTS.md + project config |
| File size threshold | 200 lines | 200 lines | 300 lines |
| Accumulation limit | 3 files | 3 files | 4 files |
| Output summarize at | >50 lines | >50 lines | >80 lines |

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.claude/agents/orchestrate.md` | Modified | 5 new sections for Claude Code runtime |
| `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md` | Modified | 5 new sections adapted for Copilot runtime |
| `.opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md` | Modified | 5 new sections adapted for ChatGPT/Codex runtime |
| `.opencode/changelog/03--agent-orchestration/v2.0.8.0.md` | Created | Changelog documenting all changes |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Each variant was edited with targeted insertions at the correct section locations. Claude was implemented first as the reference, then Copilot and ChatGPT were done in parallel with runtime-specific adaptations. Cross-file comparison confirmed thresholds scale correctly with context budgets.

No automated tests apply (markdown agent definitions). Verification was structural: confirming section placement, cross-reference accuracy, and threshold proportionality across variants.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Level 2 (not Level 3) | Additive changes only, clear scope, no architectural novelty. 25/70 complexity score. |
| "Session Recovery" naming for Copilot/ChatGPT (not "Compaction Recovery") | Those runtimes don't have compaction as a concept. "Session degradation" is the accurate term. |
| Higher thresholds for ChatGPT/Codex | Its ~220K context budget allows 50% more headroom. Thresholds scaled proportionally. |
| "save context" instead of `/compact` for non-Claude runtimes | `/compact` is a Claude Code specific command. Copilot/ChatGPT use different context management. |
| Retroactive spec folder | Work was done in a single session iteratively. Spec created after completion to document decisions and provide a reference. |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Claude orchestrate.md has all 5 sections | PASS - sections at 6, 7, 7, 8, 9 |
| Copilot orchestrate.md has all 5 sections | PASS - sections at 6, 7, 7, 8, 9 |
| ChatGPT orchestrate.md has all 5 sections | PASS - sections at 6, 7, 7, 8, 9 |
| ChatGPT thresholds > Claude/Copilot | PASS - 300/4/80 vs 200/3/50 |
| No existing content removed | PASS - all additions are new subsections |
| Cross-references accurate | PASS - anti-patterns point to correct sections |
| Changelog follows v2.0.7.3 format | PASS - same structure and heading style |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. Thresholds are heuristic-based, not empirically tested. The 200/300 line and 3/4 file limits come from the source prompt's analysis of common failure patterns, not controlled experiments.
2. "Context pressure" detection relies on the orchestrator's self-awareness. There is no automated token counter available to agents.
3. The recovery protocol assumes AGENTS.md is accessible after session degradation. If the file itself caused the overload, recovery may need manual intervention.
