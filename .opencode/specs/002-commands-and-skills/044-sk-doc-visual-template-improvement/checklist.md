# Verification Checklist: sk-doc-visual Template Improvement

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **P0** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim completion until complete |
| **P1** | Required | Must complete or receive explicit user deferral |
| **P2** | Optional | May defer with documented rationale |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

## P0

P0 checklist items are hard blockers. Completion claim is not allowed while any P0 item remains unchecked.

## P1

P1 checklist items are required unless explicitly deferred by the user and documented with rationale.
