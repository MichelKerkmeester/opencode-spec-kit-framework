As @write agent, generate one complete standalone HTML file for a documentation section layout variant.

TASK
- Section key: related-documents
- Variant: v4
- Direction: Curated Shelf
- Direction intent: Editorial shelves for start-here and deep-dive paths.
- Section purpose: Cross-reference and index section linking adjacent documentation resources.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
1) Adhere to style tokens and variables from supplied files (colors, typography, layout).
2) Keep visual style non-flashy, calm, and deliberate.
3) Allow meaningful structural divergence from the current baseline layout.
4) Produce desktop + mobile responsive behavior.
5) Include reduced-motion support and dual-theme compatibility signals.
6) Use semantic structure and keep the section readable/scannable.
7) You are NOT constrained to existing component composition patterns.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return ONLY raw HTML (no markdown fences, no explanation).
- Full standalone HTML document is required.
- Keep placeholder pattern style compatible with template defaults where useful.

UNIQUENESS CONTROLS
- Make this variant materially different in at least 3 axes:
  information flow, container strategy, grouping logic, emphasis model, or navigation treatment.
- Do not do color-only or icon-only changes.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- Avoid aggressive visual effects.
- Avoid decorative noise.
- Maintain clear hierarchy and implementation practicality.
