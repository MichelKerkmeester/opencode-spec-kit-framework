# Implementation Summary

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | `specs/002-commands-and-skills/046-sk-doc-visual-design-system/002-component-creation` |
| **Completed** | 2026-02-28 |
| **Level** | 3 |
| **Status** | Plan-stage placeholder; implementation has not started |

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

This phase did not build or modify section/component preview implementation files. The only deliverable in this document is a truthful Level 3 placeholder summary so the spec folder can satisfy required-file validation while work remains in planning.

### Planning-Stage Output

You now have a complete Level 3 document set for `002-component-creation`, including this summary file, without asserting that implementation tasks are complete. Execution tasks in `tasks.md` remain pending.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery for this update is documentation-only: template-aligned `implementation-summary.md` creation with explicit plan-stage status, followed by phase validator execution. No rollout, runtime verification, or implementation test execution occurred because implementation has not started.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Add `implementation-summary.md` during plan stage | Level 3 validation requires the file to exist, and this phase needs required-file completeness without claiming implementation completion. |
| Keep implementation status explicit in every section | Prevents false completion signals and keeps checklist/test expectations aligned with current phase reality. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Spec validator for phase folder | PASSED WITH WARNINGS (Errors: 0, Warnings: 1). Command: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/002-commands-and-skills/046-sk-doc-visual-design-system/002-component-creation`; warning is `SECTION_COUNTS` in `spec.md` (0 acceptance scenarios vs expected 6). |
| Implementation checks (lint, browser verification, interaction parity) | Pending; implementation has not started in this phase. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Implementation outputs are not present.** Section/component preview files are intentionally uncreated in this plan stage.
2. **Runtime verification is deferred.** Browser behavior checks for `scroll-progress` and copy-code interaction remain pending until implementation work begins.

This document is intentionally scoped to planning truthfulness and validation completeness for the current phase.
