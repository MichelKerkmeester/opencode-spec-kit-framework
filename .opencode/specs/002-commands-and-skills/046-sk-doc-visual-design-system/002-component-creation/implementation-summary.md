## What Was Built

Phase 002 moved from planning to implementation and delivered both extraction assets and overlap reduction.

### Delivered Assets
- Added standalone component previews:
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/components/toc-link.html`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/components/site-nav-link.html`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/components/main-grid-shell.html`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/components/scroll-progress.html`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/components/copy-code-interaction.html`
- Consolidated section library from 16 files to 8 files:
  - `hero-section.html`, `quick-start-section.html`, `feature-grid-section.html`, `operations-overview-section.html`, `extensibility-section.html`, `setup-and-usage-section.html`, `support-section.html`, `related-documents-section.html`
- Removed overlapping section files and replaced them with generic merged templates:
  - `operations-overview-section.html`, `setup-and-usage-section.html`, `support-section.html`.

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed a two-step approach:
1. Extract and create missing section/component previews from `readme-guide-v2.html` using the shared preview scaffold (`../variables/*`, `template-defaults.js`).
2. Reduce duplication by merging similar section templates into a smaller generic set and deleting redundant files.

After implementation, command and skill references were synchronized to the consolidated section model.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Consolidate many topic-specific sections into 3 generic merged sections | Reduces maintenance overhead and lowers uniqueness/duplication in section templates. |
| Keep core identity sections separate (`hero`, `quick-start`, `feature-grid`, `related-documents`, `extensibility`) | Preserves semantic coverage while still reducing overall section count. |
| Keep scaffold/import contract unchanged (`../variables/*`, `template-defaults.js`) | Ensures consistency with existing preview conventions and avoids regressions in standalone previews. |
| Update routing/reference docs after section consolidation | Prevents drift between assets and guidance used by `/create:visual_html`. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Section count reduction | PASS. `ls .opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/sections` shows 8 files. |
| Required shared imports | PASS. `rg` confirms all remaining section files include `../variables/fluid-typography.css`, `colors.css`, `typography.css`, `layout.css`, and `template-defaults.js`. |
| Genericization guardrail | PASS. `rg` against product-specific terms in sections returned no matches. |
| Spec/document sync | PASS. `SKILL.md`, `quick_reference.md`, `user_guide_profiles.md`, and `.opencode/command/create/visual_html.md` updated to consolidated model. |
| Manual browser parity checks | Pending. Run-time smoke checks for all section/component previews are still required for full closeout. |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Manual browser verification is pending.** Console cleanliness and visual/interaction parity need explicit recorded evidence.
2. **Consolidation is generic-first.** Teams that require highly specific section variants may need additional profile-specific overlays.
