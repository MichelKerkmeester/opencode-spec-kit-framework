<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built
The design-system documentation is now evidence-backed instead of claim-based.
You can trace every core layout pattern, token, component, and content section directly to the canonical HTML source.

### Extraction Evidence
- Added `spec.md` Section 13 with four evidence blocks: layout patterns, full CSS variable inventory, component catalog, and all 15 sections.
- Added source references to `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/templates/readme-guide-v2.html` for every extracted structure.

### Traceability Remediation
- Updated `plan.md` and `tasks.md` to match actual remediation phases and completion gates.
- Rebuilt `checklist.md` so each completed item includes evidence or explicit N/A rationale.
- Expanded `decision-record.md` to full Level 3 ADR quality (metadata, alternatives, five checks, rollback).

## How It Was Delivered
Delivery followed a documentation-first remediation path:
1. Extracted source evidence using `rg` against `readme-guide-v2.html`.
2. Synchronized all Level 3 docs to the same evidence model.
3. Ran `validate.sh` and `generate-context.js`, then recorded outputs in checklist evidence.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions
| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep source-anchored extraction in `spec.md` | Ensures auditability and deterministic review. |
| Treat non-applicable checklist items as explicit N/A | Removes false-positive verification claims while preserving transparency. |
| Keep runtime code untouched | Scope was documentation integrity, not UI refactoring. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Section extraction completeness | PASS (layout, variables, components, 15 sections documented with source refs) |
| Validation script | PASS (`bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/002-commands-and-skills/046-sk-doc-visual-design-system` -> Errors: 0, Warnings: 0) |
| Memory save script | PASS (`node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js specs/002-commands-and-skills/046-sk-doc-visual-design-system` -> created `memory/28-02-26_15-41__sk-doc-visual-design-system.md`) |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations
1. **Template drift risk**: If `readme-guide-v2.html` changes, Section 13 references must be refreshed.
2. **Organizational sign-off**: Product/QA sign-off rows remain pending in checklist.
