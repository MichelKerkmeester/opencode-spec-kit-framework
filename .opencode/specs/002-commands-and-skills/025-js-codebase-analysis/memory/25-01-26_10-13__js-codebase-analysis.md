<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Original spec folder was Level 3 but the multi-agent orchestration complexity (14 agents, 10 file categories) warranted Level 3+ documentation; solution: Updated all 7 spec files with Level 3+ template sections including AI Execution Framework, Workstream Organization, extended checklists with sign-off, and ADR-003; patterns: CORE + ADDENDUM template architecture v2.

## 2. OVERVIEW

Upgraded the JavaScript Codebase Analysis spec folder from Level 3 to Level 3+ documentation. This involved adding AI Execution Framework sections to plan.md, Workstream Organization and AI Execution Protocol to tasks.md, extended L3+ verification sections to checklist.md (Multi-Agent Verification, Documentation Verification, Sign-Off), and ADR-003 documenting the multi-agent orchestration strategy. Created the required implementation-summary.md file with comprehensive analysis results. All 7 spec files were updated to Level 3+ standard with proper SPECKIT_LEVEL markers. The original analysis had used 14 parallel agents (4 Opus + 10 Haiku) to analyze 91 JavaScript files, finding 34% fully compliant and 66% partially compliant with 12 P0 issues in 7 files.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Upgraded the JavaScript Codebase Analysis spec folder from Level 3 to Level 3+ documentation. This...
- Decision: Upgraded to Level 3+ instead of staying at Level 3 because the multi-a

### Message Timeline

> **User** | 2026-01-25 @ 10:13:51

Upgraded the JavaScript Codebase Analysis spec folder from Level 3 to Level 3+ documentation. This involved adding AI Execution Framework sections to plan.md, Workstream Organization and AI Execution Protocol to tasks.md, extended L3+ verification sections to checklist.md (Multi-Agent Verification, Documentation Verification, Sign-Off), and ADR-003 documenting the multi-agent orchestration strategy. Created the required implementation-summary.md file with comprehensive analysis results. All 7 spec files were updated to Level 3+ standard with proper SPECKIT_LEVEL markers. The original analysis had used 14 parallel agents (4 Opus + 10 Haiku) to analyze 91 JavaScript files, finding 34% fully compliant and 66% partially compliant with 12 P0 issues in 7 files.

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 002-commands-and-skills/025-js-codebase-analysis` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "002-commands-and-skills/025-js-codebase-analysis" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
