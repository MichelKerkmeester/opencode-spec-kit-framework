# Session Handover Document

**CONTINUATION - Attempt 1**

Session handover for preserving context and enabling seamless continuation across sessions.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: handover | v1.0 -->

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE

**Use handover.md when:**
- Ending a session with incomplete work that needs continuation
- Context needs to be preserved for a future session (same or different agent)
- Transitioning work between team members or AI sessions
- Complex multi-session features requiring state preservation
- Session compaction detected and recovery needed

**Status:** Complete

## 2. Context Transfer

### 2.1 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Upgraded to Level 3+ instead of Level 3 | Multi-agent orchestration (14 agents) triggered complexity threshold (85/100) requiring extended governance documentation | All 7 spec files updated (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, decision-record.md, files-inventory.md, implementation-summary.md) |
| Added ADR-003 for Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy | Original analysis used non-trivial parallel agent configuration (10 Haiku + 4 Opus) that should be documented for future reference | decision-record.md now contains architecture rationale |
| Marked all 29 tasks as complete with evidence citations | Original session had completed the full analysis workflow | tasks.md shows 100% completion with evidence |
| Created implementation-summary.md | Required file for all spec levels (1-3+) to document post-implementation results | New file with comprehensive analysis results |

### 2.2 Blockers Encountered

| Blocker | Status | Resolution/Workaround |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| None encountered | N/A | Full analysis completed without blockers |

### 2.3 Files Modified

| File | Change Summary | Status |
| ---- | -------------- | ------ |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/spec.md | Added Level 3+ SPECKIT_LEVEL marker, updated metadata | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/plan.md | Added AI Execution Framework, Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy sections | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/tasks.md | Added Workstream Organization, AI Execution Protocol, marked all 29 tasks complete | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/checklist.md | Added L3+ Multi-Agent Verification, Documentation Verification, Sign-Off sections | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/decision-record.md | Added ADR-003 for multi-agent orchestration | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/files-inventory.md | Updated with Level 3+ compliance matrix | COMPLETE |
| specs/.../006-js-codebase-analysis/implementation-summary.md | Created new file with analysis results (91 files analyzed: 34% fully compliant, 66% partially compliant, 12 P0 issues in 7 files) | COMPLETE |

## 3. For Next Session

### 3.1 Recommended Starting Point

- **File:** specs/002-commands-and-skills/025-js-codebase-analysis/files-inventory.md
- **Context:** Review the compliance matrix and prioritized recommendations. The analysis is complete - next steps would be implementing the recommended fixes (P0 issues in 7 files, naming standardization in 19 files)

### 3.2 Priority Tasks Remaining

1. **Optional:** Implement P0 fixes in 7 files (CDN initialization patterns, cleanup functions, error handling)
2. **Optional:** Standardize naming conventions in 19 files (camelCase violations)
3. **Optional:** Update minified files after source changes via `npm run minify`

**Note:** The analysis task is 100% complete. These are potential follow-up remediation tasks based on findings.

### 3.3 Critical Context to Load

- [x] Memory file: `memory/25-01-26_10-13__js-codebase-analysis.md`
- [x] Spec file: `spec.md` (all sections - Level 3+ documentation)
- [x] Plan file: `plan.md` (all phases complete)
- [x] Tasks file: `tasks.md` (29/29 tasks complete)
- [x] Checklist file: `checklist.md` (44/45 items verified, 1 P2 deferred)
- [x] Implementation summary: `implementation-summary.md` (comprehensive results)
- [x] Files inventory: `files-inventory.md` (compliance matrix and recommendations)

---

## 4. Validation Checklist

Before handover, verify:
- [x] All in-progress work committed or stashed
- [x] Memory file saved with current context (25-01-26_10-13__js-codebase-analysis.md)
- [x] No breaking changes left mid-implementation
- [x] Tests passing (N/A - analysis-only task, no code changes)
- [x] This handover document is complete

## 5. Session Notes

**Analysis Summary:**
- Analyzed 91 JavaScript files across 10 categories (navigation, CMS, global, form, modal, hero, video, menu, swiper, molecules)
- Used 14 parallel agents (4 Opus for deep analysis, 10 Haiku for category exploration)
- Found 16 files (34%) fully compliant, 31 files (66%) partially compliant, 0 non-compliant
- Identified 12 P0 issues in 7 files (quality standards violations)
- Identified 47 P1 issues (style guide violations, primarily naming)
- Created comprehensive compliance matrix in files-inventory.md

**Key Patterns Identified:**
- CORE + ADDENDUM template architecture v2.0
- P0/P1/P2 priority classification
- SPECKIT_LEVEL markers for documentation levels
- ANCHOR tags for semantic retrieval
- Multi-agent orchestration strategy (ADR-003)

**Spec Folder Status:**
- Level 3+ documentation complete (85/100 complexity score)
- All required files present (spec, plan, tasks, checklist, decision-record, files-inventory, implementation-summary)
- Memory context preserved for future sessions
- Ready for optional remediation phase or archival

**Next Session Entry Point:**
If continuing remediation work, start with:
```
/spec_kit:resume specs/002-commands-and-skills/025-js-codebase-analysis
```

Then review files-inventory.md "Next Steps" section for prioritized actions.
