## What Was Built

Completed implementation includes routing/structure hardening, pinned library matrixing, reference/template modernization, validator and drift enforcement, fixture-based tests, and scoped `sk-doc` touchpoints.

### Delivered Artifacts

| Area | Files | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| Routing and structure | `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/SKILL.md` | Smart-routing parity primitives and references structure updated |
| Version matrix | `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/library_versions.json` | Pins added: Mermaid `11.12.3`, ELK `0.2.0`, Chart.js `4.5.1`, anime.js `4.3.6` |
| Reference updates | `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/references/quick_reference.md`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/references/library_guide.md`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/references/quality_checklist.md`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/references/css_patterns.md`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/references/navigation_patterns.md` | Guidance aligned to pinned versions and modernized workflow |
| Template modernization | `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/templates/architecture.html`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/templates/data-table.html`, `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/templates/mermaid-flowchart.html` | Templates upgraded and validated |
| Validator hardening | `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/scripts/validate-html-output.sh` | Added checks: meta color-scheme, Mermaid hardening, canvas fallback, prefers-contrast, forced-colors |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

1. Applied routing and references updates in `sk-doc-visual/SKILL.md`.
2. Introduced `assets/library_versions.json` as version source-of-truth.
3. Updated references/templates to align with pinned versions and modernized structure.
4. Extended validator checks and added drift + fixture test scripts.
5. Updated minimal `sk-doc` touchpoints.
6. Ran packaging/validation/drift/fixture checks and recorded outputs in this child spec closeout.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use `assets/library_versions.json` as matrix source-of-truth | Enables deterministic drift checks against one machine-readable file |
| Keep drift enforcement separate (`check-version-drift.sh`) from template validator | Preserves clear command semantics and easier troubleshooting |
| Keep `sk-doc` changes limited to two implementation touchpoints | Avoids broad cross-skill refactors in this child scope |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- `package_skill.py` still reports one non-blocking warning (`RELATED RESOURCES` recommended section missing in `sk-doc-visual/SKILL.md`).
- Memory save (`CHK-052`) was not executed in this closeout step.
