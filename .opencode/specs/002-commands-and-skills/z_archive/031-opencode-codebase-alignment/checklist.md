## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **P0** | HARD BLOCKER | Completion claim is invalid until item is `[x]` with required evidence |
| **P1** | Required | Must be `[x]` or explicitly deferred with maintainer-approved rationale |
| **P2** | Optional | Can defer with rationale if P0 and P1 are satisfied |

**Evidence format (mandatory for every checked item):**
- `F:<path>` = changed or validated file path.
- `C:<command>` = verification command that was run.
- `O:<output-ref>` = command output reference (terminal excerpt, log path, or CI job URL/id).
- `T:<task-id>` = related execution task from `tasks.md`.

**Evidence record format:**
`[EVIDENCE: F:<path>; C:<command>; O:<output-ref>; T:<task-id>]`

(Plan Section 9) [EVIDENCE: F:implementation-summary.md:25-83 (changed files), tasks.md:23-111 (task-to-requirement mapping); C:cross-reference validation across spec artifacts; O:implementation-summary.md provides file-to-language-to-task mapping; T:T016,T022,T024]

## P1 - Required Checklist

(REQ-010) [EVIDENCE: F:tasks.md:72-75 (T018-T021 conditional task resolution); C:mismatch detection and reconciliation decision per T018-T019; O:tasks.md shows explicit "not triggered" decision with rationale for WS-7 path; T:T018,T019]

## Strict Blockers Encoded

Completion is strictly blocked if any condition below is true:

1. Any P0 item (`CHK-001` through `CHK-014`) remains unchecked or lacks full evidence record format.
2. Final release gate G4 is not passed with a complete verification ledger (`T017`).
3. Task chain is incomplete (`T001-T024`), except conditional tasks `T018-T021` that are explicitly marked not-triggered with proof.
4. Rollback readiness evidence is missing or untestable (`CHK-011`).
5. Traceability matrix cannot map changed files to requirements, tasks, and verification outputs (`CHK-013`).
