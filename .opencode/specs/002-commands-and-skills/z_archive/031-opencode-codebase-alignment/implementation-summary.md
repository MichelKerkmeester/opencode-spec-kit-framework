## What Changed

Level 3+ spec artifacts were created and refined, baseline audit was completed, and multi-language implementation batches were executed with behavior-preserving intent. In-scope defects discovered during alignment were fixed where required for correctness, including targeted MCP and typecheck/build breakage.

<!-- ANCHOR:why -->
## Why These Changes

- Align touched code to `sk-code--opencode` standards while preserving runtime behavior and public contracts.
- Remove known drift in core TS search/context/memory flow, utility patterns, and script/config consistency.
- Fix correctness blockers found during alignment (import-path bridge issue, TS build/typecheck regressions, and targeted test expectation drift).
- Keep change scope narrow (alignment plus in-scope defect correction only), consistent with REQ-001/REQ-002/REQ-008/REQ-012.
<!-- /ANCHOR:why -->

<!-- ANCHOR:risk-control -->
## Risk Control and Behavior Preservation

- **Behavior-preservation policy was enforced**: edits were constrained to standards alignment and local correctness fixes; no intentional runtime or API contract changes were introduced.
- Batch sequencing and stream-local checks were used to limit blast radius and keep rollback boundaries practical.
- Script-sensitive surfaces (shell + runtime-support paths) were treated as high-risk and validated with syntax/parse checks.
- Targeted test updates were applied only where failures reflected baseline expectation mismatch or local edit drift.
- **Baseline-failing-test treatment**: pre-existing full-suite `mcp_server` failures were tracked as baseline debt and are reported honestly; they were not relabeled as regressions introduced by this alignment run.

## Verification Snapshot

| Check | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `npm run typecheck` in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` | Pass | Current state passes after robust typecheck script + config cleanup work. |
| `npm run test:cli` in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` | Pass | CLI test lane green in current snapshot. |
| `npm run build` in `.opencode/skill/mcp-code-mode/mcp_server` | Pass | Prior TS2589 build blocker resolved. |
| `npm run test` in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server` | Partial / Baseline failing | Full suite remains failing from baseline; targeted failing tests updated and now pass (`context-server`, `memory-parser-extended`, `t209-trigger-setAttentionScore`). |
| JS/PY/SH/JSON syntax or parse checks on touched files | Pass | No syntax/parse failures reported for touched file set. |

<!-- ANCHOR:known-issues -->
## Remaining Known Issues

- Full `mcp_server` test suite is not fully green at repository baseline; completion status for that lane remains partial-pass.
- Some baseline debt remains outside targeted fixed tests and requires separate follow-up to close full-suite reliability.
- WS-7 standards reconciliation was **not triggered** because no proven fundamental standards-vs-runtime mismatch requiring skill-doc updates was established.

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## Rollback Notes

- Rollback should stay batch-scoped (TS core/handlers/search/utilities, JS assets, SH scripts, PY scripts, config batch) to avoid cross-stream disruption.
- Prefer reverting the specific failing batch unit and re-running only impacted verification lanes before progressing.
- Keep corrected defect-fix files coupled with their local verification evidence when reverting or replaying.

## Next Actions

1. Build and attach a consolidated verification ledger mapping each changed file to requirement IDs, task IDs, and command outputs.
2. Run and triage the remaining full `mcp_server` baseline failures to separate historical debt from any newly observed issues.
3. Complete checklist evidence updates (`CHK-001` through `CHK-014` and gate items) using the current verification snapshot.
