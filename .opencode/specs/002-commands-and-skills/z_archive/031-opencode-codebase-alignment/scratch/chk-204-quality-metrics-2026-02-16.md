# CHK-204 Extended Quality Metrics (Snapshot)

Date: 2026-02-16
Spec: `002-opencode-codebase-alignment`
Checklist target: `CHK-204`

## 1) Trend Snapshot

### A. Mission-scope language/file snapshot (normalized)
- Scope: `.opencode/**` excluding `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, `.git`, `.next`
- Total normalized files (target extensions): **549**

| Extension | Count |
|---|---:|
| `.ts` | 294 |
| `.tsx` | 4 |
| `.js` | 47 |
| `.mjs` | 4 |
| `.cjs` | 1 |
| `.py` | 13 |
| `.sh` | 56 |
| `.json` | 128 |
| `.jsonc` | 2 |

### B. Baseline comparison indicator
- Baseline inventory reference from `tasks.md` (T002 evidence): **394 files**
- Current normalized snapshot: **549 files**
- Delta indicator: **+155** files vs baseline reference

Note: The baseline inventory and current normalized scan are both mission-relevant but not guaranteed identical filter sets. Treat delta as directional drift signal, not strict like-for-like accounting.

### C. Raw broad-scope signal (unfiltered)
- Raw `.opencode/**` target-extension count (including generated/dependency surfaces): **10,497**
- Delta vs baseline reference: **+10,103**

Note: This broad signal is intentionally retained as an upper-bound drift/footprint indicator.

## 2) Failure Taxonomy

| Category | Description | Status | Resolution / Current Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline verification debt | Pre-existing failing baseline lanes (`mcp_server` tests, `mcp-code-mode` build) captured in baseline gate evidence | Known/Contained | Documented as baseline condition and handled via scoped alignment + final gate evidence path |
| Standards-vs-runtime mismatch | Potential need for WS-7 reconciliation (T018-T021) | Not triggered | No proven fundamental mismatch; tasks marked completed with not-triggered evidence |
| Optional quality extension gap | P2 optional checks (`CHK-201`..`CHK-204`) not completed at prior snapshot | Active | `CHK-204` addressed by this artifact; remaining P2 items tracked as optional backlog |
| Skill routing telemetry gap | `skill_advisor.py` returned empty output (`[]`) for this request | Observed | Proceeded with direct mission scope + explicit command evidence in this artifact |

## 3) Stream Health Summary (WS-1..WS-7)

| Stream | Status | Primary Risk | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|
| WS-1 (TS Core/Infra) | Complete | Hidden semantic drift in foundational edits | Low (gates/evidence recorded in checklist/tasks) |
| WS-2 (TS Handlers/Flow) | Complete | Control-flow regressions in handlers | Low (stream exit gate recorded as passed) |
| WS-3 (JS Runtime/Scripts) | Complete | Runtime script behavior drift | Low-Medium (script surfaces remain inherently sensitive) |
| WS-4 (Python Utilities) | Complete | Utility script behavior drift | Low |
| WS-5 (Shell Scripts) | Complete | Quoting/exit-semantics regressions | Medium residual due shell fragility; mitigated by syntax + scenario checks |
| WS-6 (Config Surface) | Complete | Parser/consumer compatibility breaks | Low |
| WS-7 (Standards Reconciliation) | Not triggered | Undetected standards/code mismatch surfacing later | Low-Medium; monitor future drift reports |

Overall stream health: **Green with targeted residual watchpoints (WS-3, WS-5, WS-7)**.

### Executed commands and concise outcomes
1. `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "Complete checklist goal CHK-204 for spec specs/002-commands-and-skills/031-opencode-codebase-alignment by creating extended quality metrics artifact in scratch only" --threshold 0.8`
   - Outcome: `[]` (no explicit skill recommendation emitted)

2. `mkdir -p "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/031-opencode-codebase-alignment/scratch" && python3 - <<'PY' ...`
   - Outcome highlights:
     - `baseline_total_files: 394`
     - `current_total_files: 10497`
     - `drift_total_files: 10103`
     - Workstream status snapshot: `WS-1..WS-6 complete`, `WS-7 not-triggered`
     - `p2_completed: 0/4`

3. `python3 - <<'PY' ...` (normalized count scan excluding generated/dependency dirs)
   - Outcome highlights:
     - `normalized_total_files: 549`
     - Extension counts: ts=294, tsx=4, js=47, mjs=4, cjs=1, py=13, sh=56, json=128, jsonc=2
