# sk-code--review KISS/DRY/SOLID Coverage Review

## Strengths
- The baseline/overlay routing plus resource map ensure that mandatory security/correctness guidance and SOLID prompts are only loaded when intent signals demand them, keeping the review scope focused on the highest-impact domains while still surfacing architecture cues (e.g., only `quick_reference`, `security_checklist`, and `code_quality_checklist` are loaded by default but the router can pull in `solid_checklist` or `removal_plan` when keywords indicate those intents). [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md:87-145]
- The quick-reference severity model (findings-first, P0–P3 rubric and next-step checklist) strongly reinforces risk prioritization and thorough evidence before offering verdicts, which already supports KISS in spirit by preventing lengthy side conversations before core issues are resolved. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:1-47]
- The `solid_checklist` explicitly enumerates SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP prompts along with architecture smells, giving reviewers concrete question starters for each principle once the checklist is loaded. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/solid_checklist.md:31-101]

## Missing rules / weak enforcement
- No dedicated guidance calls out KISS (keep interfaces lean and designs limited to current requirements); the router and quick reference never refer to `KISS`, so reviewers rely solely on high-level severity heuristics and their own discipline instead of a contracted step. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md:87-139]
- DRY (duplication avoidance) is similarly absent from the existing references; nothing nudges reviewers to detect repeated logic or advocate for reusable helpers when duplication drives future maintenance. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md:87-145]
- The SOLID support is only triggered by explicit keywords (`solid`, `architecture`, etc.), so architecture-focused reviews that do not use those terms will never load `solid_checklist`, meaning SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP prompts may be skipped unless the task text mentions “solid” or “architecture”. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md:125-191]

## Detection and wording opportunities
- Add a mini “KISS/DRY cues” section to `quick_reference.md` that (a) reminds reviewers to flag unjustified abstractions or duplicate logic as P2+ and (b) provides a short prompt (e.g., “Does this change introduce behavior for reasons other than solving the current user story?” and “Is this logic duplicated elsewhere?”). This would create an explicit scan step early in Phase 3 before diving into security/performance. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:44-64]
- Expand the intent scoring logic to treat architecture-related markers beyond the `solid` keyword (e.g., `module`, `adapter`, `interface`) so the router can load `solid_checklist` whenever the review touches new modules, which keeps SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP question prompts front and center even if the user never utters “architecture”. [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md:125-191]
- Within `quick_reference.md`, add a short callout that points reviewers to the SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP prompts with a reminder to apply those checks for any multi-responsibility change and to mention them explicitly in findings. That could read: “Use the SOLID checklist to ensure each change honors SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP (see SRP: single reason to change, OCP: extension points, etc.).” [SOURCE: .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/solid_checklist.md:33-101]
