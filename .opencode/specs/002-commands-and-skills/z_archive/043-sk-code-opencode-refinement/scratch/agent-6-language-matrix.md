# Language Coverage Matrix (sh/js/ts/json/python)

## Matrix
| Language     | Quick Reference | Style Guide | Quality Standards | Review Baseline | Notes |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Shell (sh)   | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/shell/quick_reference.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/shell/style_guide.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/shell/quality_standards.md:31-145` | Baseline overlay only (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) | P0 rules (strict mode, quoting, header) live in the shell quality doc; review needs explicit prompts to tie them to P0/P1 findings. |
| JavaScript   | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/javascript/quick_reference.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/javascript/style_guide.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/javascript/quality_standards.md:1-132` | Baseline overlay only (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) | Language logic (CommonJS, `'use strict'`, guard clauses) is spelled out in the JS quality doc; review should surface those gatekeepers explicitly. |
| TypeScript   | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/typescript/quick_reference.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/typescript/style_guide.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/typescript/quality_standards.md:1-200` | Baseline overlay only (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) | TS enforces strict tsconfig, `unknown` over `any`, interface vs type decisions; baseline review doesn’t call these out, so severity alignment is inconsistent. |
| JSON/JSONC   | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/config/quick_reference.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/config/style_guide.md` | ⚠️ Missing (`quality_standards.md` absent) | Baseline overlay only (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) | Config lacks a documented quality gate (naming, section headers, positive booleans, documentation comments) while other languages have P0/P1 docs, so review may underrate JSON drift. |
| Python      | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/python/quick_reference.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/python/style_guide.md` | ✅ `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/python/quality_standards.md:1-200` | Baseline overlay only (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) | Python quality standards mandate module docstrings, snake_case, typed signatures, and specific exception handling that currently have no parallel prompts in the baseline review checklists. |

## Missing / Inconsistent Standards (need normalization)
1. JSON/JSONC has no `quality_standards.md` even though every other target language documents P0/P1 gating (`javaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Python`, `Shell` all have such files). Without it the config layer has no published severity expectations, so `sk-code--review` cannot report config drift as a structured finding.
2. The review baseline (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:50-124`) only describes the overlay contract and generic severity buckets; there are no language-specific cues for strict shell scripts, `'use strict'` JavaScript, tsconfig strict safety, or Python docstrings/typing pulled from the overlay quality docs, so we risk inconsistent severity mapping.
3. There is no documented mapping between the `P0/P1` tiers in the language quality standards and the `P0/P1` severity model (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:66-75`), so reviewers may treat, e.g., shell strict-mode violations as P2 even though the overlay labels them as P0 hard blockers.

## Priority-Ranked Normalization Updates
1. **Add `references/config/quality_standards.md`.** Mirror the JSON/JSONC guidance in the quick reference/style guide (naming conventions, section headers, inline documentation) so configs get an explicit quality tier; reuse shell/JS/Python patterns to keep the structure consistent. This closes the only language missing a documented gate.
2. **Expand `sk-code--review` baseline with a short “OpenCode overlay anchors” section.** List the top P0/P1 checks for Shell, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and JSON (e.g., strict mode/headers, `'use strict'` + guard clauses, tsconfig strictness + `unknown`, module docstrings + typed signatures, and positive configuration naming). Reference each `sk-code--opencode` quality doc so reviewers can quickly apply those rules.
3. **Document a P0/P1 mapping table in the review reference (e.g., in `code_quality_checklist.md` or a new overlay note).** Tie each overlay’s hard-blocking items (strict mode, typed contracts, config structure) explicitly to the review severity levels defined at `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md:66-75` so classification stays consistent across skills.
