# Feature Specification: sk-code--opencode refinement

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.2 -->

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This specification defines a governance-first refinement of `sk-code--opencode` that tightens comment guidance for machine parsing, keeps numbered ALL-CAPS section headers stable, and increases architecture quality rigor through explicit KISS/DRY + SOLID checks. The work reuses proven patterning from `139-hybrid-rag-fusion` and aligns with `sk-code--review` baseline behavior.

**Key Decisions**: preserve the current header taxonomy (`## 1. OVERVIEW` style), reduce narrative inline comments, and codify parse-friendly trace comments with strict quality gates.

**Critical Dependencies**: existing skill corpus under `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/`, review baseline in `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/`, and prior governance patterns in `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/`.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Current OpenCode standards provide strong cross-language structure, but inline comment rules are still broad enough to allow verbose human-style narration that reduces signal quality for AI-assisted parsing. At the same time, the numbered ALL-CAPS section convention is valuable for deterministic structure detection and must remain intact during refinement. Architecture checks are distributed across skills and need stronger KISS/DRY + SOLID enforcement across the primary standards path.

### Purpose
Produce a precise, AI-optimized standards refinement for `sk-code--opencode` that preserves existing section structure conventions, narrows inline comment usage to high-value parseable intent, and strengthens design-quality gates with explicit SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP coverage.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
1. Analyze prior work under `139-hybrid-rag-fusion`, including both code-adjustment outcomes and reusable governance/pattern structures.
2. Analyze current `sk-code--review` baseline and SOLID references for compatibility and reuse.
3. Update `sk-code--opencode` guidance to reduce inline comments while preserving numbered ALL-CAPS section headers.
4. Define inline-comment formatting optimized for AI parsing, not narrative prose.
5. Strengthen KISS/DRY + SOLID quality checks, explicitly covering SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP.
6. Ensure language coverage spans shell, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON/JSONC, and Python with broader codebase applicability.
7. Allow optional, bounded improvements to `sk-code--review` when they improve baseline-overlay alignment.

### Out of Scope
- Renaming skill directories or changing skill identity.
- Rewriting unrelated skills outside `sk-code--opencode` and optional targeted `sk-code--review` alignment.
- Changes to memory artifacts in any `memory/` subtree.
- Frontend-specific standards that belong to `sk-code--web`.

- **SC-003**: KISS/DRY and all SOLID dimensions (SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP) are present in reviewable checklist form.
- **SC-004**: Shell, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and JSON/JSONC coverage remains complete and internally consistent.
- **SC-005**: Optional `sk-code--review` changes, if made, are minimal, aligned, and do not dilute baseline security/correctness expectations.

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Existing section taxonomy in language references | Breaking this would destabilize structure parsing and existing patterns | Treat numbered ALL-CAPS headings as non-regression invariant and test for presence |
| Dependency | Review baseline precedence model | Over-editing could blur baseline vs overlay responsibilities | Keep review changes optional and minimal, limited to alignment wording |
| Risk | Over-tightening comments harms maintainability | Useful rationale could be removed | Define explicit allowed-comment categories and provide balanced examples |
| Risk | Cross-language drift after policy changes | One language may diverge from the shared contract | Apply shared policy first, then language-specific deltas, then checklist verification |
| Risk | Scope creep into unrelated skill rewrites | Delays and noisy diffs | Enforce scope lock to files in Section 3 only |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Verification commands for scoped markdown checks complete in normal local CLI execution without manual patching loops.

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Security/correctness minimums from `sk-code--review` baseline remain intact if optional review files are edited.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Re-running static checks on updated standards files yields consistent pass/fail outcomes for required policy markers.
- **NFR-R02**: The refined policy remains deterministic for AI agents by using explicit, machine-detectable wording patterns.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

## 8. EDGE CASES

### Policy Boundaries
- JSON comments remain valid only in JSONC contexts and must stay concise and rationale-focused.
- Example snippets that intentionally show bad comments are allowed only inside explicit good/bad demonstration blocks.

### Cross-Skill Alignment
- `sk-code--review` may remain unchanged when alignment value is low; this does not block completion.
- If review files are edited, they must preserve findings-first output contracts and severity-first behavior.

### Mixed-Language Repositories
- Rules must remain usable when one change set spans shell scripts, TS/JS modules, Python tooling, and config files.

## 9. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Triggers |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Scope | 22/25 | Multi-file standards refinement across shared references, language guides, and checklists |
| Risk | 19/25 | Policy-level changes can alter agent behavior quality across the codebase |
| Research | 18/20 | Requires pattern extraction from prior Level 3+ work and cross-skill compatibility analysis |
| Multi-Agent | 11/15 | Standards affect orchestrated review/implementation agents |
| Coordination | 13/15 | Baseline-overlay alignment and governance evidence requirements |
| **Total** | **83/100** | **Level 3+** |

## 10. RISK MATRIX

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R-001 | Comment policy becomes too restrictive for practical debugging context | Medium | Medium | Allow narrow debug rationale comments with explicit limits |
| R-002 | Header-preservation rule is accidentally weakened in one language guide | High | Medium | Add non-regression checks in shared and language checklists |
| R-003 | SOLID/KISS/DRY additions become verbose and hard to apply | Medium | Medium | Use concise pass/fail prompts with concrete anti-pattern examples |
| R-004 | Optional review updates introduce baseline contract drift | High | Low | Require precedence model retention and minimal diff scope |

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: AI Agent Applying Standards (Priority: P0)

**As an** OpenCode coding agent, **I want** clear, parseable, low-noise comment and structure rules, **so that** I can generate consistent code with minimal ambiguity across languages.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given language-specific guidance, when applying standards, then numbered ALL-CAPS section headers remain unchanged.
2. Given inline comment decisions, when comments are written, then they follow the reduced rationale-only policy.

### US-002: Reviewer Enforcing Design Quality (Priority: P1)

**As a** code reviewer using baseline + overlay rules, **I want** explicit KISS/DRY and SOLID prompts, **so that** design regressions are found early and reported consistently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a review pass, when architecture quality is evaluated, then SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP prompts are available and actionable.
