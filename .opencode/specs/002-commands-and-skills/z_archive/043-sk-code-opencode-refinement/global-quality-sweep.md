# Global Quality Sweep Protocol: 043-sk-code-opencode-refinement

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->

<!-- ANCHOR:purpose -->
## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the mandatory closure protocol that must execute before any completion claim for `043-sk-code-opencode-refinement`.

Protocol coverage is global and includes every changed file in scope across:
- `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/` shared references, language guides, and checklists.
- Optional `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/` files if the conditional alignment trigger is met.
- Level 3+ spec artifacts used to prove planning, decision, verification, and closure consistency.

## Mandatory Closure Protocol

### 1) Global Testing Round (Required)

- Execute one consolidated verification round across all changed files.
- Include policy assertions for inline comment threshold, AI-oriented comment semantics, numbered ALL-CAPS headers, and KISS/DRY/SOLID coverage.
- Include spec artifact validation command for this folder.
- Record every command and result in the evidence table (`ANCHOR:evidence-table`).

### 2) Global Bug Detection Sweep (Required)

- Aggregate all defects discovered during the global testing round.
- Log each defect with severity, owner, and status.
- Completion claim is blocked unless unresolved counts are:
  - `P0 = 0`
  - `P1 = 0`

### 3) `sk-code--opencode` Compliance Audit (Required)

- Audit changed `sk-code--opencode` files for alignment to refined policy contract.
- Verify scope lock and non-regression rules from `spec.md` and `decision-record.md`.
- Publish compliance result and evidence path in the table.

### 4) Conditional Standards Update Pathway (Conditional)

- Evaluate whether updated `sk-code--opencode` policy creates unresolved mismatch with `sk-code--review` baseline detection.
- If mismatch exists:
  - Apply minimal scoped updates to optional review files.
  - Re-run targeted review alignment verification commands.
  - Record evidence as Applied.
- If mismatch does not exist:
  - Mark pathway `N/A` with rationale and supporting command evidence.

## Evidence Table

| Evidence ID | Protocol Step | Command / Check | Result Summary | Artifact / Link | Defects (P0/P1/P2) | Owner | Status |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|-------|--------|
| EVT-001 | Global Testing Round | Run command bundle sections 1, 2, 3, and spec validation | PASS. Policy semantics assertions, header invariants, and KISS/DRY/SOLID coverage all passed; spec validation passed with one advisory warning (`SECTION_COUNTS`). | `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/043-sk-code-opencode-refinement/scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md` | `0/0/0` | Spec closure owner | Closed |
| EVT-002 | Global Bug Detection Sweep | Consolidate defects from EVT-001 outputs and scoped diffs | PASS. No defects detected across verification outputs and scoped changed-file audit. | `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/043-sk-code-opencode-refinement/scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md` | `0/0/0` | Spec closure owner | Closed |
| EVT-003 | `sk-code--opencode` Compliance Audit | Scope check + policy/checklist invariant audit | PASS. Scope audit confirmed changed files remained within declared implementation scope (4 files). | `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/043-sk-code-opencode-refinement/scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md` | `0/0/0` | Spec closure owner | Closed |
| EVT-004 | Conditional Standards Update Pathway | Review mismatch decision + optional command bundle section 4 | PASS (Applied). Conditional review alignment path executed and assertions passed after minimal scoped review updates. | `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/043-sk-code-opencode-refinement/scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md` | `0/0/0` | Spec closure owner | Closed |

<!-- ANCHOR:closure-gate -->
## Closure Gate

Completion claim for this spec is permitted only when all conditions below are true:

- [x] Global testing round completed with published evidence (`EVT-001`).
- [x] Global bug detection sweep completed with unresolved `P0=0` and `P1=0` (`EVT-002`).
- [x] `sk-code--opencode` compliance audit completed with evidence (`EVT-003`).
- [x] Conditional standards update pathway decision completed (`EVT-004`) as either Applied or N/A with rationale.
- [x] Spec documents synchronized and checklist evidence slots updated.

**Closure Gate Decision**: SATISFIED WITH WARNING. All mandatory closure checks passed with unresolved defects `P0=0`, `P1=0`; spec validation reported one advisory warning (`SECTION_COUNTS`).
