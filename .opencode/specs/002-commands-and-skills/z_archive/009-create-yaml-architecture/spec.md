# Feature Specification: Create Commands YAML-First Architecture Refactor

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Architectural refactor of all 6 create commands (`.opencode/command/create/`) to align with the spec_kit YAML-first workflow pattern. The current create commands use an inverted workflow model where `.md` files contain inline workflows and YAML is supplementary, whereas spec_kit commands correctly use YAML as the primary workflow engine. This refactor standardizes the architecture, fixes broken auto mode, eliminates phantom dispatch vulnerabilities, and aligns with sk-documentation standards.

**Key Decisions**: Golden reference strategy (refactor skill.md first, replicate to others), Keep setup phase in .md (complex setup stays pre-YAML), Dual YAML mode (auto + confirm)

**Critical Dependencies**: Existing spec_kit commands as architectural reference, sk-documentation skill for DQI enforcement

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The 6 create commands use an inverted workflow model: `.md` files contain full inline workflows and YAML serves as supplementary configuration. The spec_kit commands use the correct YAML-first model where `.md` routes to YAML immediately and YAML is the primary workflow engine. This inconsistency causes: broken auto mode (no auto YAMLs exist), phantom dispatch vulnerability (no REFERENCE ONLY annotations), missing quality gates (no circuit_breaker, workflow_enforcement sections), and inconsistent document creation standards (no DQI enforcement or validate_document.py integration).

### Purpose
Refactor all 6 create commands to use YAML-first architecture matching the spec_kit convention, enabling auto mode, eliminating phantom dispatch, and enforcing consistent document quality standards.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Refactoring 6 `.md` command files to use EXECUTION PROTOCOL banner and YAML-first routing
- Renaming 6 existing YAML files to `_confirm` variants
- Creating 6 new `_auto` YAML variants (12 YAMLs total)
- Adding missing structural sections to all YAMLs (circuit_breaker, workflow_enforcement, etc.)
- Aligning with sk-documentation standards (DQI enforcement, validate_document.py, canonical templates)
- Fixing bugs: step count metadata, orphaned create_agent.yaml, missing auto mode support

### Out of Scope
- Modifying spec_kit commands - already correct architecture
- Changing the actual document templates or content that commands produce
- Refactoring non-create commands (other command categories)
- Changing the skill system itself

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | spec_kit commands as reference architecture | Pattern to replicate | Already implemented and stable |
| Dependency | sk-documentation skill | DQI templates and validate_document.py | Already available |
| Risk | Regression in existing commands | High | Phase 1 bug fixes first; test each command after refactor |
| Risk | agent.md complexity (670 lines inline) | Medium | Refactor skill.md first as golden reference; apply pattern |
| Risk | Large scope (24-30 files) | Medium | 4-phase approach; session boundaries at phase completion |
| Risk | Multi-session execution required | Low | Memory saves at phase boundaries for context continuity |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Consistency
- **NFR-C01**: All 6 `.md` files follow identical EXECUTION PROTOCOL structure
- **NFR-C02**: All 12 YAML files follow identical structural sections

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Pattern changes to one command can be replicated across all 6 mechanically
- **NFR-M02**: Clear separation between `.md` (routing + setup) and YAML (workflow engine)

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Auto mode produces equivalent output to confirm mode (minus confirmation pauses)

<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty input: Commands should handle missing user arguments gracefully (existing behavior preserved)
- Maximum length: Long file paths or names in generated documents (existing behavior preserved)

### Error Scenarios
- Missing YAML file: `.md` should report clear error if referenced YAML not found
- Invalid mode parameter: Default to confirm mode if neither auto nor confirm specified
- Partial refactor state: If interrupted mid-phase, each phase is independently functional

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Auto Mode Command Execution (Priority: P0)

**As a** developer using create commands, **I want** auto mode variants that execute without confirmation pauses, **so that** I can quickly generate documents in batch or scripted workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a create command invoked with auto mode, **When** execution starts, **Then** all steps run without user confirmation
2. **Given** auto mode output, **When** compared to confirm mode output, **Then** the generated documents are identical
3. **Given** auto mode with missing required input, **When** invoked, **Then** a clear error message is shown before any file creation

---

### US-002: Consistent Command Architecture (Priority: P0)

**As a** command maintainer, **I want** all create commands to follow the same YAML-first architecture as spec_kit commands, **so that** pattern changes can be replicated mechanically across all commands.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** any create command `.md` file, **When** inspected, **Then** it contains EXECUTION PROTOCOL banner and routes to YAML
2. **Given** any create command YAML, **When** inspected, **Then** it contains all required structural sections (circuit_breaker, workflow_enforcement)
3. **Given** structural comparison with spec_kit commands, **When** analyzed, **Then** the architecture pattern matches

---

### US-003: Phantom Dispatch Prevention (Priority: P1)

**As a** system administrator, **I want** inline workflow content in `.md` files annotated as REFERENCE ONLY, **so that** AI agents cannot accidentally execute deprecated inline workflows instead of YAML workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** any create command `.md` file, **When** an AI agent reads it, **Then** REFERENCE ONLY annotations prevent inline workflow execution
2. **Given** YAML-first routing, **When** a command is invoked, **Then** the YAML workflow is always the execution target

---

### US-004: Document Quality Enforcement (Priority: P1)

**As a** documentation consumer, **I want** DQI enforcement via validate_document.py integrated into create command verification, **so that** all generated documents meet quality standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a create command verification step, **When** executed, **Then** validate_document.py is called on the output
2. **Given** a generated document with quality issues, **When** validated, **Then** specific DQI failures are reported

---

### US-005: Bug-Free Command Metadata (Priority: P0)

**As a** command framework consumer, **I want** step count metadata to accurately reflect actual YAML steps, **so that** progress tracking and reporting are correct.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** any YAML file, **When** step_count metadata is read, **Then** it matches the actual number of steps defined
2. **Given** create_agent.yaml, **When** referenced from agent.md, **Then** the YAML loads correctly (not orphaned)

---

### US-006: Dual Mode Routing (Priority: P0)

**As a** developer, **I want** each create command `.md` to detect execution mode and route to the correct YAML, **so that** auto and confirm modes work transparently.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a create command invoked without mode specification, **When** processed, **Then** it defaults to confirm mode
2. **Given** a create command invoked with auto mode, **When** processed, **Then** it routes to `_auto.yaml`
3. **Given** a create command invoked with confirm mode, **When** processed, **Then** it routes to `_confirm.yaml`

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 12. OPEN QUESTIONS

- Should Phase 0 (@write agent verification) be moved into YAML in a future iteration, or permanently remain in .md?
- Are there any undocumented create commands beyond the 6 identified?
- Should `_auto` YAMLs skip ALL confirmations or only step-level confirmations (preserving Phase 0 gate)?
