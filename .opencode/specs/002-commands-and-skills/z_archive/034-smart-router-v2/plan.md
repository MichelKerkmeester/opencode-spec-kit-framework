# Implementation Plan: Smart Router V2 Rollout

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | Markdown documentation and skill routing metadata |
| **Framework** | OpenCode skill framework with template-driven spec workflow |
| **Storage** | Filesystem only (Public repo + Barter repo) |
| **Testing** | Spec validation script and manual routing scenario checks |

### Overview
This rollout updates 10 skill definition files to Smart Router V2 behavior using weighted keyword classification, recursive references/assets discovery, and stack/language detection where applicable. The implementation is documentation-driven and preserves existing entry points, constraints, and skill invocation semantics. Verification focuses on routing fidelity, consistency of scoring semantics, and non-breaking behavior across Public and Barter targets.

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Phased documentation-first rollout with backward-compatible in-place skill definition updates.

### Key Components
- **Routing Classification Layer**: Replaces first-hit matching with weighted intent scoring and threshold-based fallback.
- **Discovery Layer**: Adds recursive references/assets traversal with bounded depth and safe no-directory fallback.
- **Stack Detection Layer**: Adds marker-based stack/language detection for workflow-code targets.
- **Compatibility Guardrail Layer**: Preserves existing invocation APIs, command naming, and constraints.

### Data Flow
User prompt terms are scored against skill-specific weighted keyword groups, then optional recursive resources and stack/language markers refine the final route selection; if confidence is low, routing falls back to the current generic path so behavior remains stable.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Setup
- [x] Confirm 10 rollout targets and repository boundaries (Public 8 + Barter 2)
- [x] Establish Level 3 spec documentation baseline in target spec folder
- [ ] Prepare comparison checklist for pre/post routing behavior

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Apply weighted keyword classification updates to Public skill files (8 targets)
- [ ] Apply weighted keyword classification updates to Barter skill files (2 targets)
- [ ] Add recursive references/assets discovery documentation where directories exist
- [ ] Add stack/language detection routing details to code workflow skills
- [ ] Preserve current invocation semantics and explicit constraints in every updated skill

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Validate all modified skill docs for consistency and non-breaking semantics
- [ ] Run scenario-based routing checks for weighted scores, ties, and fallback
- [ ] Confirm cross-repo parity where behavior should match
- [ ] Complete implementation summary and close checklist evidence

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Unit | N/A (documentation-only routing spec updates) | N/A |
| Integration | Skill routing semantics across 10 targets | Manual scenario matrix |
| Manual | Prompt-to-route validation and fallback behavior | CLI inspection + reviewer walkthrough |

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Access to Public skill files | Internal | Green | Public rollout cannot proceed |
| Access to Barter skill files | External directory | Green | Cross-repo parity validation delayed |
| Existing template and validation scripts | Internal | Green | Documentation quality checks reduced |
| Current skill behavior baseline | Internal | Yellow | Accuracy improvement claims become weaker |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: Routing regressions, ambiguity spikes, or any observed breaking behavior in skill invocation.
- **Procedure**: Revert modified SKILL.md targets to previous commit state in the affected repository, then re-run manual scenario checks to confirm baseline behavior restoration.

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Baseline snapshots captured for each target skill file
- [ ] Rollout sequence documented (Public first, Barter second)
- [ ] Verification scenario matrix prepared

### Rollback Procedure
1. Stop rollout in the current repository and record failing scenario.
2. Revert modified target SKILL.md files to previous known-good revision.
3. Re-run manual route checks for the failing scenario plus fallback cases.
4. Record root cause and patch plan before attempting another rollout pass.

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No
- **Reversal procedure**: N/A

<!-- ANCHOR:critical-path -->
## L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Finalize target inventory and scoring model assumptions** - 1 hour - CRITICAL
2. **Update 8 Public skill documents with Smart Router V2 rules** - 3-5 hours - CRITICAL
3. **Update 2 Barter skill documents with parity rules** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL
4. **Run verification matrix and close checklist evidence** - 2-4 hours - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: 7-12 hours

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Public skill updates can run in two workstreams (code-related vs workflow-related skills).
- Barter updates can begin once Public patterns are stable enough for copy-aligned adaptation.

## L3: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

### ADR-001: Weighted Scoring with Safe Fallback

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: First-hit keyword matching is brittle for multi-signal prompts and causes avoidable routing mismatches.

**Decision**: Use weighted keyword scoring with confidence thresholds and preserve fallback to generic routing when confidence is low.

**Consequences**:
- Better routing precision for composite requests.
- Additional documentation complexity mitigated by shared scoring guidelines.

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Deterministic first-hit matching: rejected due to poor handling of mixed-intent prompts.
