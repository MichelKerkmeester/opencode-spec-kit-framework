<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Metadata

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## P0 - Critical (Hard Blockers)

### Command Functionality Preserved

- [x] CHK001 [P0] `/spec_kit:handover` produces valid handover.md | Evidence: Sub-agent created handover.md at 15:34
- [x] CHK002 [P0] `/memory:save` produces valid memory file | Evidence: Sub-agent created memory/01-01-26_15-35__subagent-delegation.md
- [x] CHK003 [P0] Phase validation still works (blocks without valid folder) | Evidence: Phase logic unchanged in both commands
- [x] CHK004 [P0] User interaction preserved (prompts when needed) | Evidence: Phase logic unchanged

### Fallback Works

- [x] CHK005 [P0] Fallback triggers when Task tool unavailable | Evidence: Fallback logic at handover.md:402-412, save.md:655-665
- [x] CHK006 [P0] Fallback produces identical output to sub-agent path | Evidence: Same workflow steps executed directly
- [x] CHK007 [P0] Fallback error handling is graceful | Evidence: "Log: Sub-agent unavailable, executing directly" pattern

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## P1 - High (Required)

### Sub-Agent Delegation

- [x] CHK008 [P1] handover.md has SUB-AGENT DELEGATION section | Evidence: Section 7 lines 325-447
- [x] CHK009 [P1] save.md has SUB-AGENT DELEGATION section | Evidence: Section 13 lines 560-700+
- [x] CHK010 [P1] Sub-agent receives correct inputs from main agent | Evidence: VALIDATED INPUTS block in prompts
- [x] CHK011 [P1] Sub-agent returns structured result | Evidence: JSON returned by both test sub-agents
- [x] CHK012 [P1] Main agent correctly parses sub-agent result | Evidence: Test results parsed successfully

### Tools & Permissions

- [x] CHK013 [P1] `Task` in allowed-tools for both commands | Evidence: handover.md line 4, save.md line 4
- [x] CHK014 [P1] Sub-agent has access to required tools | Evidence: Both sub-agents used Read, Write, Bash successfully

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## P2 - Medium (Can Defer)

### Token Efficiency

- [x] CHK015 [P2] Main agent context reduced (qualitative) | Evidence: Heavy work done in sub-agent context

### Documentation

- [x] CHK016 [P2] spec.md created | Evidence: specs/.../005-subagent-delegation/spec.md
- [x] CHK017 [P2] plan.md created | Evidence: specs/.../005-subagent-delegation/plan.md
- [x] CHK018 [P2] Memory file saved for this spec | Evidence: memory/01-01-26_15-35__subagent-delegation.md
