### Context

The anobel.com codebase contains approximately 91 JavaScript files across multiple directories including navigation, CMS, global utilities, forms, and minified bundles. A comprehensive analysis requires deciding whether to include all file types or exclude certain categories.

### Constraints
- Analysis must complete within reasonable time bounds
- Minified files have different evaluation criteria than source files
- Some files may be legacy or scheduled for deprecation

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Include all 91 JavaScript files in the analysis inventory, with differentiated evaluation criteria for source vs. minified files.

**Details**: Source files will be evaluated against both quality standards and style guide. Minified files will only have their manifest validated and will be excluded from style compliance checks since they are auto-generated.

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Include all with differentiation** | Complete picture, accurate inventory | More complex evaluation logic | 8/10 |
| Exclude minified files entirely | Simpler analysis | Incomplete inventory, may miss manifest issues | 5/10 |
| Analyze minified content | Thoroughness | Meaningless for style, wasted effort | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Provides the most comprehensive view while maintaining practical evaluation criteria.

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Complete inventory needed for accurate compliance picture |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Three alternatives considered |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Minimal criteria differentiation solves the problem |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly enables comprehensive analysis |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Does not constrain future analysis approaches |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Complete file inventory ensures nothing is missed
- Differentiated criteria keeps analysis practical
- Establishes clear methodology for future analyses

**Negative**:
- Slightly more complex tracking - Mitigation: Clear categorization in inventory

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Minified files obscure source issues | L | Cross-reference with source files |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- File discovery phase (Phase 1)
- Compliance matrix structure

## ADR-002: Severity Classification Criteria

### Metadata

| Field | Value |

| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-01-24 |
| **Deciders** | Development Team |

---

### Context

When analyzing files for compliance issues, consistent severity classification is essential for prioritizing remediation efforts. Without clear criteria, issues may be inconsistently rated across different files.

### Constraints
- Must align with existing P0/P1/P2 priority system
- Must be objective and reproducible
- Must support actionable prioritization

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Use three-tier severity classification based on impact and risk criteria.

**Details**:
- P0 (Hard Blocker): Security vulnerabilities, breaking functionality, missing critical error handling
- P1 (Required): Pattern violations, naming inconsistencies, missing documentation
- P2 (Optional): Style preferences, optimization opportunities, minor deviations

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Three-tier P0/P1/P2** | Aligns with project standards, clear | May oversimplify edge cases | 9/10 |
| Numeric scoring (1-10) | Fine-grained | Harder to prioritize, subjective | 4/10 |
| Five-tier system | More granularity | Overcomplicates for this scope | 5/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Aligns with existing project priority conventions and provides clear, actionable categories.

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Consistent classification required for prioritization |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Three alternatives evaluated |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Three tiers sufficient for prioritization |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Enables prioritized recommendations |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Can be refined in future if needed |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Consistent with project-wide priority system
- Easy to communicate and understand
- Supports clear remediation planning

**Negative**:
- Edge cases may need judgment calls - Mitigation: Document specific criteria

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Inconsistent application | M | Document specific examples for each tier |

## ADR-003: Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->
### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-01-24 |
| **Deciders** | User + AI Orchestrator |

---

### Context

Analyzing 91 JavaScript files requires significant effort. The orchestrate.md agent guidelines allow for parallel agent dispatch to improve efficiency. Need to decide on agent composition and distribution strategy.

### Constraints
- Maximum 20 agents per orchestrate.md guidelines
- Opus agents for deep analysis, Haiku for exploration
- User requested "4 opus agents and 10 sonnet agents simultaneously"

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Deploy 14 agents in parallel - 10 Haiku (exploration) for file categories, 4 Opus (deep analysis) for cross-cutting concerns.

**Details**:
- 10 Haiku agents assigned to file category directories (global, navigation, form, cms, modal, hero, video, menu, swiper, molecules)
- 4 Opus agents assigned to: Quality standards synthesis, Style guide synthesis, Cross-file pattern analysis, Spec folder creation
- All agents dispatched simultaneously for maximum parallelism

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **14 parallel (10 Haiku + 4 Opus)** | Fast, specialized roles | Coordination complexity | 9/10 |
| Sequential analysis (1 agent) | Simple coordination | Very slow, context loss | 3/10 |
| All Opus agents (14) | Deep analysis everywhere | Expensive, slower | 6/10 |
| All Haiku agents (14) | Fast exploration | May miss nuances | 5/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Balances speed (Haiku for breadth) with depth (Opus for synthesis), matches user's request for multi-agent approach.

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | 91 files require parallel processing for reasonable time |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Four agent strategies considered |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | 14 agents sufficient to cover all categories |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Enables comprehensive analysis in single session |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Strategy reusable for future codebase analyses |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Completed full analysis in single session
- Each file category received focused attention
- Cross-cutting patterns identified through Opus synthesis

**Negative**:
- Required careful result merging - Mitigation: Structured output format
- Some duplicate analysis possible - Mitigation: Clear category boundaries

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Agent result conflicts | L | Orchestrator synthesis resolves |
| Incomplete category coverage | L | Validated 47/47 source files covered |
