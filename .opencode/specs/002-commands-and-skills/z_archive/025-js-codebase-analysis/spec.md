# Feature Specification: JavaScript Codebase Alignment with workflows-code Skill

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level3plus-govern | v2.0 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Comprehensive analysis of all 91 JavaScript files in the anobel.com codebase to evaluate compliance with the workflows-code skill's quality standards and style guide. This analysis will produce a compliance matrix, identify issues by severity, and generate prioritized recommendations for alignment.

**Key Decisions**: Analysis scope includes all JS files in src/2_javascript/, evaluation against code_quality_standards.md and code_style_guide.md

**Critical Dependencies**: Access to workflows-code skill reference documentation

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The anobel.com JavaScript codebase contains 91 files that have evolved over time without systematic validation against the established workflows-code skill standards. There is no comprehensive compliance matrix documenting which files adhere to quality and style guidelines, making it difficult to prioritize improvement efforts.

### Purpose
Produce a complete compliance assessment of all JavaScript files against workflows-code standards, enabling data-driven prioritization of code quality improvements.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Analysis of all 91 JavaScript files in src/2_javascript/
- Compliance evaluation against code_quality_standards.md
- Compliance evaluation against code_style_guide.md
- Categorization by file type (navigation, CMS, global, etc.)
- Issue identification and severity classification
- Prioritized recommendations for remediation

### Out of Scope
- Automatic code fixes - analysis and documentation only
- CSS or HTML file analysis - JavaScript only
- Minified file content analysis (manifest validation only)
- Performance benchmarking - quality compliance focus

### Files to Analyze

| Directory | File Count | Category |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| src/2_javascript/navigation/ | 8 | Navigation components |
| src/2_javascript/cms/ | 15 | CMS integrations |
| src/2_javascript/global/ | 12 | Global utilities |
| src/2_javascript/form/ | 6 | Form handling |
| src/2_javascript/z_minified/ | 50 | Minified bundles |

## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | Complete file inventory | All 91 JS files catalogued with paths and categories |
| REQ-002 | Quality standards compliance check | Each file evaluated against code_quality_standards.md |
| REQ-003 | Style guide compliance check | Each file evaluated against code_style_guide.md |
| REQ-004 | Compliance matrix produced | Single document showing pass/fail per file per standard |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-005 | Issues categorized by severity | P0/P1/P2 classification for each identified issue |
| REQ-006 | Recommendations prioritized | Actionable list ordered by impact and effort |

<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: 100% of JavaScript files analyzed and documented in compliance matrix
- **SC-002**: All issues classified by severity (P0/P1/P2)
- **SC-003**: Recommendations document produced with clear prioritization
- **SC-004**: No breaking changes identified without mitigation plan

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | workflows-code reference docs | Analysis cannot proceed without standards | Verify docs exist and are accessible |
| Risk | Large file count (91) | Extended analysis time | Batch processing by category |
| Risk | Inconsistent coding patterns | Complex classification | Use multi-criteria evaluation |
| Risk | Minified files obscure issues | May miss source problems | Cross-reference with source files |

<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Analysis should complete within single session

### Quality
- **NFR-Q01**: Each compliance evaluation must cite specific line numbers or patterns

### Documentation
- **NFR-D01**: All findings must be traceable to specific standards sections

<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### File Categories
- Empty files: Flag as P2 issue, recommend removal
- Stub files: Document and exclude from compliance scoring
- Generated files: Identify and note special handling

### Pattern Variations
- Legacy patterns: Document as technical debt, not immediate violations
- Third-party code: Exclude from compliance scoring, document dependencies

## 10. RISK MATRIX

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R-001 | Incomplete file discovery | H | L | Use systematic glob patterns |
| R-002 | Inconsistent evaluation criteria | M | M | Document evaluation rubric first |
| R-003 | Missing context for legacy code | M | M | Note patterns without condemning |

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Compliance Overview (Priority: P0)

**As a** developer, **I want** a compliance matrix for all JS files, **so that** I can quickly see which files need attention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given the matrix, When I look up any JS file, Then I see its compliance status for each standard category
2. Given the matrix, When I filter by non-compliant, Then I see all files requiring work

---

### US-002: Prioritized Remediation (Priority: P1)

**As a** developer, **I want** prioritized recommendations, **so that** I can tackle the most impactful issues first.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given recommendations, When I read them in order, Then P0 issues appear before P1 issues
2. Given each recommendation, When I read it, Then I understand the specific fix needed

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 12. OPEN QUESTIONS

- Should minified files be excluded from style compliance (they are auto-generated)?
- Are there any files marked for deprecation that should be excluded?
