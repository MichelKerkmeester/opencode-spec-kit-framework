# workflows-code Skill Alignment with Barter Patterns

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## Problem Statement

The current anobel.com `workflows-code` skill may lack organizational patterns and routing logic that have been refined in the Barter system. Without analysis, we cannot determine if improvements from Barter would benefit this project's skill implementation.

<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## Goals

1. **Analyze Barter patterns**: Understand the routing logic and organization in Barter's workflows-code skill
2. **Improve router logic**: Update SKILL.md with more effective routing and decision trees
3. **Organize assets/**: Create logical sub-folders for better file discovery
4. **Organize references/**: Create logical sub-folders for better documentation navigation
5. **Improve usability**: Make the skill easier to use and maintain

## Scope

### In Scope

- SKILL.md router logic updates
- assets/ folder reorganization into sub-folders
- references/ folder reorganization into sub-folders
- File path updates in SKILL.md to reflect new structure
- Documentation of new organization patterns

### Out of Scope

- Adding new core functionality to the skill
- Changing the fundamental skill architecture
- Modifying other skills
- Creating new reference documents (only reorganizing existing)

<!-- /ANCHOR:scope -->

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## Success Criteria

- [ ] SKILL.md router improved with Barter patterns
- [ ] assets/ organized into intuitive sub-folders
- [ ] references/ organized into intuitive sub-folders
- [ ] All internal file references remain valid
- [ ] Skill loads and functions correctly after changes
- [ ] Navigation to resources is clearer and faster

<!-- /ANCHOR:success-criteria -->

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## Dependencies

- Access to Barter system's workflows-code skill for analysis
- Current anobel.com workflows-code skill files

<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Breaking file references | Medium | High | Verify all links after reorganization |
| Barter patterns not applicable | Low | Medium | Analyze before implementing |
| Scope creep into functionality | Medium | Medium | Strict scope enforcement |
