## Overview

Based on learnings from the anobel.com performance optimization project (024-performance-optimization), this spec documents required updates to the `workflows-code` skill to incorporate performance patterns, Core Web Vitals remediation workflows, and multi-agent research methodologies.

### Problem Statement

The `workflows-code` skill currently lacks:
1. **Performance Audit Workflow** - No structured phase for CWV analysis before implementation
2. **CWV Remediation Patterns** - Missing LCP, FCP, TBT optimization techniques
3. **Resource Loading Patterns** - No documentation for preconnects, async CSS, script deferral
4. **Webflow Constraints** - Platform limitations not documented in skill references
5. **Multi-Agent Research** - 10-agent specialization model not codified

### Root Cause

The skill was designed for implementation workflows but lacks a "Phase 0: Research" stage that was proven effective in the performance optimization project.

## Scope

### In Scope (P0 - Must Have)

| Item | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Performance Audit Workflow | Add Phase 0 research stage with CWV analysis | Prevents 20s+ LCP issues |
| CWV Remediation Guide | Document LCP safety timeout, preconnects, async patterns | Reusable optimization patterns |
| Resource Loading Reference | Preconnect, prefetch, preload patterns for Webflow | Faster page loads |

### In Scope (P1 - Should Have)

| Item | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Third-Party Performance | GTM delay, analytics deferral patterns | Reduced main thread blocking |
| Verification Patterns | Before/after PageSpeed protocol | Measurable improvements |
| Webflow Constraints Doc | Platform limitations and workarounds | Prevents impossible tasks |

### In Scope (P2 - Nice to Have)

| Item | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Multi-Agent Research | 10-agent specialization model | Comprehensive codebase analysis |
| Performance Checklist | Pre-flight checks for performance work | Consistent quality |

### Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Script bundling patterns | User preference against bundling |
| Video poster optimization | Removed from anobel.com scope |
| TypeKit removal | Requires font audit outside skill scope |

## Research Summary

**10 parallel Opus/Sonnet agents** analyzed the workflows-code skill and performance patterns:

| Agent | Focus | Key Finding |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Skill Structure | Missing Phase 0 research stage, no CWV remediation guide |
| 2 | Performance Patterns | 9 patterns identified: preconnect, GTM delay, async CSS, etc. |
| 3 | Multi-Agent Research | 10-agent specialization model effective for comprehensive analysis |
| 4 | Webflow Constraints | Platform limitations need explicit documentation |
| 5 | Verification Patterns | Before/after protocol with PageSpeed integration needed |
| 6-10 | Supporting Analysis | Folder structure, template requirements, reference gaps |

See `research.md` for complete findings.
