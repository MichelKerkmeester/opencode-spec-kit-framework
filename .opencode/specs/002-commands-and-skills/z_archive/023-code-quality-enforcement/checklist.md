## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### AI Self-Verification Requirement

When claiming completion, the AI MUST:

1. **Load** this checklist
2. **Verify** each item systematically, starting with P0 items
3. **Mark** items `[x]` with evidence when verified
4. **Block** completion claims until all P0/P1 items are verified
5. **Document** any deferred P2 items with reasons

### Priority Enforcement

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0] Critical** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1] High** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval to defer |
| **[P2] Medium** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

### Evidence Format

```markdown
- [x] CHK005 [P0] Checklist file created | Evidence: File exists at expected path
- [x] CHK018 [P0] Gate added to workflow | Evidence: SKILL.md lines XX-YY
```
