# Implementation Summary: Code Quality Enforcement

Enhancement to the workflows-code skill adding active code quality and style enforcement for **all code files** (JavaScript + CSS).

---

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## 1. OVERVIEW

### Feature Branch
`004-code-quality-enforcement`

### Implementation Date
2026-01-02 (Phase 1: JavaScript), 2026-01-02 (Phase 2: CSS Expansion)

### Status
✅ COMPLETE (Phase 2 - CSS Expansion)

### Summary
Added active code quality and style enforcement to the workflows-code skill by:
1. Creating an actionable validation checklist for **JavaScript and CSS** code
2. Creating an enforcement reference with compliant/non-compliant examples for both languages
3. Integrating a Code Quality Gate (Phase 1.5) into the workflow for all code files

## 3. KEY CHANGES

### Phase 1.5: Code Quality Gate

Added a mandatory quality gate between Implementation and Debugging phases:

```
Implementation → Code Quality Gate → Debugging → Verification
```

**Gate Requirements:**
- Load `code_quality_checklist.md` before claiming JavaScript implementation complete
- Validate all P0 items (file headers, sections, naming, initialization)
- Fix P0 violations before proceeding (HARD BLOCK)
- P1 violations require fix or documented deferral
- P2 violations can be deferred with documented reason

### Checklist Structure

The validation checklist covers 7 categories (6 JavaScript, 1 CSS) with priority-tagged items:

**JavaScript (Sections 1-6):**

| Category | P0 | P1 | P2 | Total |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| File Header | 4 | 2 | 1 | 7 |
| Section Organization | 3 | 5 | 1 | 9 |
| Comment Quality | 1 | 4 | 1 | 6 |
| Naming Conventions | 2 | 4 | 0 | 6 |
| Initialization Pattern | 3 | 4 | 0 | 7 |
| Formatting | 0 | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| **JS Subtotal** | **13** | **23** | **5** | **41** |

**CSS (Section 7):**

| Category | P0 | P1 | P2 | Total |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| Custom Property Naming | 1 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| Attribute Selectors | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
| BEM Naming | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 |
| Animation Properties | 1 | 2 | 0 | 3 |
| File Organization | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 |
| **CSS Subtotal** | **4** | **7** | **2** | **13** |

**Combined Total: 17 P0, 30 P1, 7 P2 = 54 items**

### Enforcement Reference

The enforcement reference provides:
- Validation prompts for each standard category (JS and CSS)
- Pattern recognition tables for identifying violations
- Compliant and non-compliant examples for both languages
- Remediation instructions for common violations
- Enforcement workflow (Section 8)
- Language-specific gate selection table

**CSS Enforcement Sections (7.1-7.4):**
- Custom Property Naming - semantic prefixes (`--font-*`, `--vw-*`, etc.)
- Attribute Selector - case-insensitivity flag `i`
- BEM Naming - correct separator usage (`--` for elements, `-` for modifiers)
- Animation Properties - GPU-accelerated only, `will-change` management

## 4. VERIFICATION

### Checklist Verification

| Category | P0 | P1 | P2 | Status |
|----------|----|----|----|----|
| Pre-Implementation | 2/2 | 2/2 | - | ✅ |
| Checklist Creation | 5/5 | 2/2 | 1/1 | ✅ |
| Enforcement Reference | 1/1 | 3/3 | 1/1 | ✅ |
| SKILL.md Integration | 2/2 | 3/3 | 1/1 | ✅ |
| Testing & Validation | 2/2 | 2/2 | 1/1 | ✅ |
| Documentation | 1/1 | 2/2 | - | ✅ |
| File Organization | - | 2/2 | 1/1 | ✅ |

**P0 Status**: 13/13 COMPLETE
**P1 Status**: 16/16 COMPLETE
**P2 Deferred**: 1 item (memory context - saved in Step 13)

### Sample Code Verification

Tested checklist against `src/2_javascript/video/video_background_hls_hover.js`:
- ✅ File header format (three-line, box-drawing)
- ✅ Section organization (IIFE, numbered headers)
- ✅ Naming conventions (snake_case)
- ✅ Initialization pattern (INIT_FLAG, guard check)
- ✅ Comment quality (WHY not WHAT)

## 5. DEVIATIONS FROM PLAN

**Phase 1**: None. Implementation followed the plan exactly.

**Phase 2 (CSS Expansion)**: Not in original plan - added as follow-up based on user feedback that enforcement should cover all languages in the codebase, not just JavaScript.

---

## 6. PHASE 2: CSS EXPANSION

### Changes Made

1. **code_quality_checklist.md**:
   - Added Section 7: CSS Style Checks (13 items)
   - Updated header to reference all code files
   - Added language coverage note
   - Added CSS verification summary template
   - Added CSS quick reference pass criteria

2. **code_style_enforcement.md**:
   - Added Sections 7.1-7.4 for CSS enforcement
   - Added language coverage note in overview
   - Updated enforcement workflow (Section 8) with language-specific gate selection
   - Added CSS production example references

3. **SKILL.md**:
   - Updated Phase 1.5 from "JavaScript" to "all code files"
   - Added JavaScript + CSS file type routing
   - Added CSS P0 items to Phase 1.5 description
   - Added CSS-specific NEVER rules
   - Added CSS success criteria

### CSS P0 Items (Blocking)

| ID | Check |
|----|-------|
| CHK-CSS-01 | Custom properties use semantic prefixes |
| CHK-CSS-04 | Attribute selectors use `i` flag |
| CHK-CSS-06 | Class names follow BEM convention |
| CHK-CSS-09 | Animations use GPU-accelerated properties only |

## 7. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Test in practice**: Apply the Code Quality Gate during next JavaScript/CSS implementation
2. **Refine checklist**: Add/remove items based on real-world usage
3. **Monitor effectiveness**: Track whether violations are caught and fixed
4. **Consider HTML expansion**: Add HTML-specific checks if needed in future
