# Feature Specification: Code Quality Enforcement - Requirements & User Stories

Add active code quality and style enforcement to the workflows-code skill with explicit checkpoints, validation checklists, and blocking gates.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec | v1.0 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Enhancement
- **Level**: 2
- **Tags**: workflows-code, code-quality, style-enforcement, skill-enhancement
- **Priority**: P1
- **Feature Branch**: `004-code-quality-enforcement`
- **Created**: 2026-01-02
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Input**: User request to improve code quality and code styling (comments, sections) enforcement in the workflows-code skill

### Stakeholders
- OpenCode AI Assistant (primary user of the skill)
- Developers working on anobel.com frontend code

### Problem Statement
The workflows-code skill has comprehensive code quality standards (code_quality_standards.md) and style guides (code_style_guide.md), but enforcement is currently passive. The AI can reference these documents but there is no active checkpoint that validates code against these standards before claiming implementation is complete. This leads to inconsistent code quality and missed style violations.

### Purpose
Integrate active code quality and style enforcement into the workflows-code skill's implementation phase, ensuring all JavaScript files are validated against established standards (file headers, section organization, comments, naming conventions) before completion can be claimed.

### Assumptions

- Modern ES6+ JavaScript files are the primary target
- Existing code_quality_standards.md and code_style_guide.md are the authoritative sources
- Enforcement should be blocking (cannot claim complete without passing)
- The AI performs validation (not automated tooling)

**Assumptions Validation Checklist**:
- [x] All assumptions reviewed with stakeholders
- [x] Technical feasibility verified for each assumption
- [x] Risk assessment completed for critical assumptions
- [x] Fallback plans identified for uncertain assumptions

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Create actionable code quality checklist (`assets/checklists/code_quality_checklist.md`)
- Create enforcement reference document (`references/standards/code_style_enforcement.md`)
- Update SKILL.md to integrate Code Quality Gate into workflow
- Define validation prompts the AI uses to check code
- Provide compliant vs non-compliant examples

### Out of Scope
- Automated linting tools or scripts (enforcement is AI-assisted, not automated)
- CSS-specific enforcement (focus is JavaScript, CSS has lighter requirements)
- Changes to the underlying standards documents (they are authoritative)
- Enforcement for non-JavaScript files

<!-- ANCHOR:user-stories -->
## 3. USERS & STORIES

### User Story 1 - Code Quality Gate Before Completion (Priority: P0)

As the AI assistant completing a JavaScript implementation, I need a mandatory quality gate that validates my code against established standards before I can claim the work is complete, so that code quality is consistently enforced.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because this is the core value proposition - without the gate, enforcement doesn't happen.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing any JavaScript file and verifying the gate is triggered before completion claim.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** AI has completed JavaScript implementation, **When** it attempts to claim "done" or "complete", **Then** the Code Quality Gate is triggered and checklist must be validated
2. **Given** the Code Quality Gate is triggered, **When** all checklist items pass, **Then** completion can be claimed
3. **Given** the Code Quality Gate is triggered, **When** any P0 checklist item fails, **Then** completion is blocked until fixed

---

### User Story 2 - Actionable Validation Checklist (Priority: P0)

As the AI assistant, I need a specific, testable checklist that I can use to validate JavaScript files against style standards, so that validation is consistent and thorough.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because without a clear checklist, the gate cannot function.

**Independent Test**: Checklist can be tested by applying it to any existing JavaScript file and verifying each item is testable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a JavaScript file to validate, **When** I load the code quality checklist, **Then** each item has clear pass/fail criteria
2. **Given** the checklist, **When** I check file headers, **Then** I can verify the three-line format with box-drawing characters
3. **Given** the checklist, **When** I check section organization, **Then** I can verify numbered section headers and standard order

---

### User Story 3 - Enforcement Reference with Examples (Priority: P1)

As the AI assistant, I need a reference document with compliant and non-compliant examples for each standard, so that I can accurately identify violations and know how to fix them.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because examples improve accuracy but the gate can function with just the checklist.

**Independent Test**: Reference document can be tested by using it to fix violations in sample code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a validation failure, **When** I consult the enforcement reference, **Then** I find a compliant example to follow
2. **Given** uncertain compliance, **When** I compare code to examples, **Then** I can determine if it passes or fails

---

### User Story 4 - Integrated Workflow Routing (Priority: P1)

As the AI assistant, I need the Code Quality Gate integrated into the existing workflow routing, so that it triggers automatically at the right point in the implementation phase.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because integration makes enforcement seamless but manual invocation is a fallback.

**Independent Test**: Test by completing an implementation and verifying the gate appears in the workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** Phase 1 (Implementation) is nearing completion, **When** code changes are done, **Then** the Code Quality Gate is automatically suggested
2. **Given** the workflow routing, **When** keywords like "done", "complete" are detected, **Then** verification is required first

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- **REQ-FUNC-001:** System MUST include a code quality checklist with testable items for file structure, section organization, comments, and naming conventions
- **REQ-FUNC-002:** System MUST categorize checklist items by priority (P0/P1/P2) where P0 items block completion
- **REQ-FUNC-003:** System MUST integrate the Code Quality Gate into the workflows-code skill's Phase 1 completion
- **REQ-FUNC-004:** System MUST provide compliant and non-compliant examples for each major standard
- **REQ-FUNC-005:** System MUST route to the code quality checklist when implementation keywords are detected
- **REQ-FUNC-006:** System MUST block completion claims until all P0 checklist items pass

### Traceability Mapping

| User Story | Related Requirements | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| Story 1 - Code Quality Gate | REQ-FUNC-003, REQ-FUNC-006 | Core gate functionality |
| Story 2 - Validation Checklist | REQ-FUNC-001, REQ-FUNC-002 | Checklist structure |
| Story 3 - Enforcement Reference | REQ-FUNC-004 | Examples and guidance |
| Story 4 - Integrated Workflow | REQ-FUNC-005 | Routing integration |

## 5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Checklist validation should not significantly slow down the workflow (AI reads and evaluates)

### Usability
- **NFR-U01**: Checklist items must be clearly written and unambiguous
- **NFR-U02**: Examples must be directly applicable to the codebase patterns

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Checklist should reference code_style_guide.md and code_quality_standards.md as sources of truth
- **NFR-M02**: Changes to standards should only require updates to the checklist, not the enforcement document

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 6. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- What happens when a file has no sections (e.g., very small utility)? Minimum requirements apply.
- What happens when a file is minified? Minified files are exempt from style checks.

### Error Scenarios
- What happens when the AI cannot determine compliance? Mark as uncertain and apply conservative judgment.
- What happens when code intentionally deviates from standards? Document deviation with justification.

### State Transitions
- What happens when user overrides the gate? Log override and proceed (user authority).
- What happens when code is partially compliant? P0 items must pass, P1/P2 can be deferred with documentation.

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 7. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All JavaScript implementations go through the Code Quality Gate before completion
- **SC-002**: Checklist covers 100% of file header, section, and comment standards from code_style_guide.md
- **SC-003**: P0 items block completion with no exceptions (unless user override)
- **SC-004**: Enforcement examples match existing codebase patterns

### KPI Targets

| Category | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Adoption | % of implementations using gate | 100% | Workflow enforcement |
| Quality | P0 violations in new code | 0 | Manual review |
| Completeness | Standards coverage | 100% | Checklist audit |

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Owner | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| code_quality_standards.md | Internal | Existing | Green | Cannot define quality checks |
| code_style_guide.md | Internal | Existing | Green | Cannot define style checks |
| SKILL.md (workflows-code) | Internal | Existing | Green | Cannot integrate gate |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| R-001 | Checklist too strict, slows development | Medium | Low | Make P2 items optional, allow user override | Implementer |
| R-002 | Checklist not comprehensive enough | Medium | Low | Audit against style guide to ensure coverage | Implementer |

### Rollback Plan

- **Rollback Trigger**: Gate causes significant workflow disruption
- **Rollback Procedure**:
  1. Remove gate routing from SKILL.md
  2. Make checklist optional instead of blocking
  3. Keep enforcement reference for optional use

<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->
