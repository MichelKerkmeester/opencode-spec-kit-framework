<!-- ANCHOR:notation -->
## Summary

All 9 implementation tasks completed by 5 parallel sub-agents.

**Execution**: Tasks distributed across parallel agents for maximum efficiency:
- Agent 1: T001 (wait_patterns.js)
- Agent 2: T002 (validation_patterns.js)
- Agent 3: T003, T004, T005 (observer + lenis + animation)
- Agent 4: T006, T007 (code quality + quick reference)
- Agent 5: T008, T009 (HLS + third-party integrations)
