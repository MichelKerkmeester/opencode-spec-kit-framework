## What Was Built

The OpenCode framework now has a full `sk-visual-explainer` skill — a Skill Graph architecture with 10 interconnected nodes — reverse-engineered from nicobailon/visual-explainer v0.1.1. A subsequent gap remediation phase closed 30 additional gaps (4 Critical, 15 Medium, 11 Low) identified through systematic comparison of the source repository against the initial implementation, hardening the skill's CSS pattern library, library guide, and navigation patterns with modern CSS and accessibility coverage.

### Phase 1: Original Implementation

You can invoke the sk-visual-explainer skill to generate production-quality HTML diagrams, review code diffs visually, recap project state, and verify claims — all from a single Smart Router that loads only the context it needs. The skill routes queries at 0.95 confidence via skill_advisor.py and stays at 1,682 words, well under the 5,000-word package_skill.py limit.

The architecture decomposes the original 700-line single-file prompt into 10 node files organized by the 4-phase workflow (Think > Structure > Style > Deliver). SKILL.md acts as a lean router; index.md provides a Map of Content with wikilinks to all 10 nodes. References follow a 3-tier progressive loading strategy: quick_reference.md loads always, css_patterns.md and navigation_patterns.md load conditionally for CSS-heavy tasks, and library_guide.md and quality_checklist.md load on demand only.

Five commands ship with full contracts: `/visual-explainer:generate`, `/visual-explainer:diff-review`, `/visual-explainer:plan-review`, `/visual-explainer:recap`, and `/visual-explainer:fact-check`. Three production HTML templates (architecture, mermaid-flowchart, data-table) were ported as-is from the source and serve as exemplars. Validate-html-output.sh provides a 10-check static validator for generated output.

### Phase 2: Gap Remediation

After the initial implementation, 30 gaps were identified through systematic diff analysis of the source repository. These gaps were classified by severity and fixed across 7 skill files using a dual-agent parallel execution strategy — one agent handling css_patterns.md and library_guide.md simultaneously, the other handling the remaining five files. No regressions were introduced: all original patterns were preserved and SKILL.md word count held at 1,682 words.

Critical fixes (4 items): CSS-first placeholder image generation replacing surf-cli (C1), CSS Grid patterns with named template areas (C2), container queries with `@container` syntax (C3), and Framer Motion library entry in library_guide.md (C4). Medium fixes (15 items) covered scroll-snap, logical properties, aspect-ratio, clamp(), CSS subgrid, CSS nesting, `:has()` selector, view transitions, `@layer`, FLIP technique, performance budgets, will-change, paint containment, composite-only animations, and accessibility patterns including `prefers-reduced-motion` and `forced-colors`. Low fixes (11 items) extended quick_reference.md with modern CSS, added scroll-timeline and animation-composition to library_guide.md, and added Chrome DevTools integration to integration-points.md.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

**Phase 1** ran across 5 phases over a single session: Research & Analysis (T001-T007) mapped the source content to Skill Graph node candidates; Skill Graph Core (T008-T019) created SKILL.md and all 10 nodes; References & Assets (T020-T027) built the reference library and ported HTML templates; Commands & Integration (T028-T036) created the 5 command files and updated skill_advisor.py; Verification (T037-T042) ran package_skill.py, tested routing, verified word count, and validated all wikilinks and HTML templates.

**Phase 2** used a dual-agent parallel execution strategy to maximize throughput. Two agents ran simultaneously: Batch 1 addressed css_patterns.md (11 patterns) and library_guide.md (12 items) in parallel; Batches 3-6 addressed the remaining 5 files (navigation_patterns.md, rules.md, commands.md, integration-points.md, quick_reference.md) sequentially. All 30 gap patterns were verified via grep pattern matching against the updated files. package_skill.py was re-run post-remediation and returned PASS. SKILL.md word count was confirmed unchanged at 1,682 words.

Confidence that the skill is correct and complete comes from three sources: automated validation (package_skill.py PASS, validate-html-output.sh PASS on all 3 templates), routing verification (skill_advisor.py at 0.95 confidence), and grep-based pattern matching against all 30 remediation targets.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Skill Graph architecture over monolithic SKILL.md | Content exceeds 10,000 words total; monolithic approach would fail the 5,000-word hard limit enforced by package_skill.py |
| `workflows-` prefix | Skill defines a multi-phase process (Think > Structure > Style > Deliver), matching the convention used by sk-documentation, sk-git |
| 3-tier progressive loading | Loading all 46KB of references on every invocation wastes context; ALWAYS/CONDITIONAL/ON_DEMAND tiers reduce initial load by ~31KB |
| MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS for conflicting keywords | 5 keywords (diagram, flowchart, review, architecture, data) already mapped in skill_advisor.py; MULTI_SKILL_BOOSTERS preserves existing routing |
| 9 quality checks (2 added) | Original 7 checks miss accessibility (color contrast, semantic HTML) and reduced-motion support; both are standard web requirements |
| snake_case for reference filenames | package_skill.py enforces snake_case for references; kebab-case fails validation |
| HTML templates ported as-is | Production-quality exemplars; modifying them risks introducing regressions without adding value |
| Project-local output to `.opencode/output/visual/` | Original path (`~/.agent/diagrams/`) pollutes home directory and breaks portability |
| CSS-first placeholder generation (replaces surf-cli) | Eliminates external dependency, ensures reproducibility across environments, zero API cost; CSS gradients provide sufficient visual fidelity for placeholder use cases |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| package_skill.py validation (Phase 1) | PASS — 1 non-blocking emoji warning, no errors |
| package_skill.py validation (Phase 2, post-remediation) | PASS — no regressions |
| skill_advisor.py routing test | PASS — 0.95 confidence for "create visual explainer" |
| SKILL.md word count | PASS — 1,682 words (66% under 5,000-word limit), unchanged post-remediation |
| index.md wikilink resolution | PASS — 10/10 links resolve to existing files |
| HTML template validation (validate-html-output.sh) | PASS — all 3 templates pass all 10 checks |
| Gap remediation grep verification | PASS — all 30 gap patterns confirmed present in skill files |
| No regressions in original patterns | PASS — original content preserved; no existing patterns removed |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **CSS-first placeholders are not photorealistic.** The CSS-first approach (replacing surf-cli) produces geometric shapes and gradients rather than AI-generated images. This is acceptable for placeholder and demo purposes; users needing photorealistic images must provide their own assets.

2. **Smart Router classification is heuristic.** The Python pseudocode in SKILL.md classifies tasks by keyword matching. Ambiguous queries (e.g., "diagram" without context) may route to the wrong loading tier. Mitigation: the ALWAYS tier (quick_reference.md) covers the most common operations, and agents can manually load additional references.

3. **HTML template CDN URLs may become stale.** The 3 ported templates reference CDN URLs for Mermaid v11, Chart.js v4, and anime.js. These are current as of the implementation date. library_guide.md documents the versions in use; update CDN URLs if libraries release breaking changes.

4. **No automated accessibility validation.** validate-html-output.sh checks for the presence of `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries and semantic HTML markers, but does not run WCAG automated tooling. Full accessibility compliance requires manual review or integration with axe-core.
