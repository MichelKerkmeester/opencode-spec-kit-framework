# Feature Specification: OpenCode Codebase Alignment

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Align OpenCode implementation files in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Shell, JSON, and JSONC to the standards defined by `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode` with a behavior-preserving, KISS-first approach. The work is intentionally limited to consistency, correctness, and bug fixes discovered during alignment, with no feature expansion.

**Key Decisions**:
- Keep runtime behavior unchanged; style and structure changes must be non-semantic.
- Fix only defects discovered during alignment that are directly in touched files.
- Prioritize the smallest safe change set per file before any broader cleanup.

**Critical Dependencies**:
- `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode` as the normative standard.
- Existing test and validation commands for each language stack.
- Maintainer review for any standard-vs-reality mismatch before changing skill guidance.

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
OpenCode scripts and runtime code were built over time across multiple languages, while the unified standards skill was defined later. This has created uneven style, inconsistent structure, and avoidable defects in touched areas, which increases review effort and weakens trust that code and documented standards match.

### Purpose
Deliver one standards-aligned codebase surface for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Shell, JSON, and JSONC that preserves behavior, removes consistency debt, and fixes bugs discovered in-scope during alignment.

### Objectives
1. Reach enforceable consistency with `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode` for touched files.
2. Preserve runtime behavior and external contracts for all modified components.
3. Resolve in-scope defects found during alignment without introducing side work.
4. Keep implementation simple, local, and easy to review.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Code and script files in OpenCode-owned paths that use `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.json`, `.jsonc`.
- Alignment of headers, structure, naming, comments, error-handling style, and config conventions per skill standards.
- Bug fixes found while aligning touched files when the fix is required to keep behavior correct and verifiable.
- Minimal test/verification updates required only when existing checks break due to corrected defects.

### Out of Scope
- New product features, architectural rewrites, or unrelated refactors.
- Dependency upgrades, tooling migrations, or introducing new frameworks.
- Reformatting untouched files solely for visual consistency.
- Third-party, generated, vendored, build artifact, or cache directories.

<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: All touched files in TS/JS/PY/SH/JSON/JSONC conform to the active standards set.
- **SC-002**: No accepted change introduces a deliberate behavior difference in runtime or public contract.
- **SC-003**: Each discovered in-scope defect in touched files is fixed or explicitly deferred with rationale.
- **SC-004**: Verification commands for impacted areas pass before completion is claimed.
- **SC-005**: Reviewers can map every change to one of: alignment, defect correction, or required verification adjustment.
- **SC-006**: Any standards-doc updates remain consistent with validated production code patterns.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Behavior Preservation Across Touched Paths**
   - **Given** a batch that updates `.opencode/agent/context.md` support code and one `.opencode/skill` helper script,
   - When the same pre-change command sequence is run after alignment,
   - Then outputs, exit codes, and side effects remain unchanged except for corrected in-scope defects.

2. **Language-Specific Standards Alignment Validation**
   - **Given** one touched file in each language group (`.ts/.js/.py/.sh/.json/.jsonc`),
   - When each file is reviewed against `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode` standards,
   - Then naming, structure, error-handling style, strictness/config conventions, and documentation patterns match the language-specific rules.

3. **Bug-Fix Safety in Alignment Scope**
   - **Given** a defect discovered while aligning a touched shell script,
   - When the fix is applied,
   - Then a reproducible failing case is demonstrated before the fix, a passing case is demonstrated after the fix, and no unrelated file is modified.

4. **Verification Gate Enforcement Before Completion Claim**
   - **Given** a completed language-scoped batch,
   - When completion is proposed,
   - Then required impacted checks run first, all required gates pass, and the batch is blocked from completion if any required gate fails.

5. **No Contract Breaks for Public Interfaces**
   - **Given** a touched module exporting a command, script entrypoint, or configuration contract used by other workflows,
   - When alignment changes are applied,
   - Then command signatures, input/output contract shape, expected file paths, and integration call points remain backward-compatible.

6. **Memory/Context Save for Session Continuity**
   - **Given** a major alignment milestone or session stop point,
   - When context is saved,
   - Then memory is generated via `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js [spec-folder-path]` and records decisions, verification evidence location, open risks, and next-step handoff state.

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Standards source (`workflows-code--opencode`) | High | Use as baseline and log any conflict before changing docs |
| Dependency | Existing test/verification commands | High | Run per impacted area before completion claim |
| Dependency | Maintainer review availability | Medium | Keep batches small and independently verifiable |
| Risk | Hidden semantic drift during style edits | High | Restrict to local edits, compare behavior, run targeted checks |
| Risk | Scope creep from opportunistic cleanup | Medium | Reject unrelated edits and track separately |
| Risk | Regression from bug fix side effects | High | Reproduce, patch minimally, verify exact failing path |
| Risk | Cross-language inconsistency in standards interpretation | Medium | Apply per-language references and document edge cases |
| Risk | Over-complex remediation | Medium | Apply KISS gate before merge; prefer smallest valid patch |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Modified code remains straightforward to read and reason about.
- **NFR-M02**: No new deep abstraction layers are introduced for style-only goals.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Post-change execution paths for touched areas remain stable.
- **NFR-R02**: Error handling remains explicit and testable.

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: No measurable performance degradation is intentionally introduced.

### Governance
- **NFR-G01**: Every batch records verification evidence before merge readiness.
- **NFR-G02**: Standards/document mismatches are reconciled with traceable rationale.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Mixed-language directories where scripts call each other across TS/JS/PY/SH.
- JSONC files where comment normalization must not break tooling expectations.
- Legacy modules with intentional deviations required for compatibility.

### Error Scenarios
- Formatting updates that accidentally alter command parsing behavior in shell scripts.
- Type narrowing cleanup that changes runtime truthiness behavior in TS/JS.
- Bug fixes that reveal additional latent issues outside current touch scope.

### Handling Rules
- If behavior risk is uncertain, keep existing behavior and mark for follow-up.
- If compatibility is ambiguous, choose backward-compatible path first.
- If a bug requires wider refactor, stop and split into a separate tracked change.

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Predictable Standards (Priority: P0)

**As a** contributor, **I want** touched OpenCode files to follow one language-appropriate standard, **so that** review and maintenance are predictable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a touched file, when reviewed, then it matches documented standards for its language.
2. **Given** a standards question, when checking skill docs, then the guidance matches real code patterns.

### US-002: Safe Alignment (Priority: P0)

**As a** maintainer, **I want** alignment changes to preserve behavior, **so that** reliability is not traded for style consistency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** a completed batch, when verification runs, then impacted checks pass.
2. **Given** a change under review, when tracing intent, then it is either alignment or in-scope bug fix.

### US-003: KISS Execution (Priority: P1)

**As a** reviewer, **I want** minimal patches with clear intent, **so that** defects are easier to detect and rollback is safe.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. **Given** any patch, when inspected, then unnecessary abstraction is absent.
2. **Given** a defect fix in alignment, when examined, then fix scope is local and justified.

<!-- ANCHOR:execution-protocol -->
## 12. Execution Protocol & Workstream Coordination

### Autonomous Execution Model (Level 3+)
- Default operating mode is **autonomous execution** within the approved scope, with no pause required for notify-only checkpoints.
- All changes must remain behavior-preserving, KISS-first, and restricted to alignment plus in-scope defect correction.
- If a proven standards error is found, update `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode` docs in the same governed flow with explicit rationale.
- Autonomous execution may continue in parallel streams only while each stream remains independently testable and independently revertible.

### Workstream Boundaries (Parallel-Allowed)

| Workstream | Allowed Scope | Must Not Do | Independent Verification Minimum |
|------------|---------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| WS-TSJS | `.opencode/**/*.ts`, `.opencode/**/*.tsx`, `.opencode/**/*.js`, `.opencode/**/*.mjs`, `.opencode/**/*.cjs` | Cross-language refactors into Python/Shell streams | Impacted lint/type/test checks for touched JS/TS paths |
| WS-PY | `.opencode/**/*.py` | API contract rewrites or shared behavior changes outside touched files | Impacted Python lint/test/command checks |
| WS-SH | `.opencode/**/*.sh` | Command behavior redesign, shell framework swaps | Script execution checks with strict-mode and failure-path validation |
| WS-CONFIG | `.opencode/**/*.json`, `.opencode/**/*.jsonc` | Key schema redesign or unrelated config migration | Consumer parse/load checks for each touched config |
| WS-STANDARDS | `.opencode/skill/workflows-code--opencode/**/*` (only when fundamental mismatch is proven) | Policy expansion unrelated to validated mismatch | Cross-check doc rule against validated production behavior |

### Workstream Alias Map (Compact)

| Descriptive Workstream | Numeric Alias IDs |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| WS-TSJS | WS-1, WS-2, WS-3 |
| WS-PY | WS-4 |
| WS-SH | WS-5 |
| WS-CONFIG | WS-6 |
| WS-STANDARDS | WS-7 |

### Checkpoint Classification (Notify-Only vs Hard-Blocking)

| Checkpoint | Mode in Autonomous Execution | Required Action |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|
| Spec Review | Notify-only | Post summary and continue once scope remains unchanged |
| Standards Baseline Confirmed | **Hard-blocking** | Stop until baseline is explicitly confirmed or corrected |
| Language Batch Complete (each stream) | Notify-only | Post batch diff intent + verification evidence, then continue |
| Verification Report Review | **Hard-blocking** | Stop until full verification report is reviewed and accepted |
| Launch Approval | **Hard-blocking** | Stop until explicit launch approval is recorded |
| Scope Change Detected | **Hard-blocking** | Stop, re-scope, and obtain updated approval before further edits |

### Merge and Review Flow
1. Open or update one merge unit per workstream batch with a narrow diff and explicit rollback boundary.
2. Link each changed file to one reason: standards alignment, in-scope defect fix, or required verification adjustment.
3. Run stream-local verification first, then run any required cross-stream integration checks.
4. Request review with a structured evidence bundle; unresolved hard-blocking checkpoints prevent merge.
5. Merge only when all P0 requirements and all hard-blocking checkpoints are satisfied.

### Evidence Requirements (Required for Every Batch)
- Verification command list with pass/fail outcomes and timestamps.
- File-level mapping from changed paths to requirement IDs (REQ-001 through REQ-012 as applicable).
- Defect evidence for bug fixes (repro before, validation after).
- Standards mismatch proof and correction rationale for any WS-STANDARDS updates.
- Explicit statement that behavior is preserved for touched execution paths.

<!-- /ANCHOR:questions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback-boundaries -->
## 18. ROLLBACK BOUNDARIES

1. Rollback unit is one language-scoped or subsystem-scoped batch.
2. Each batch must be independently revertible without requiring follow-up fixes.
3. No batch may combine standards alignment with unrelated behavior work.
4. If a bug fix expands beyond touched-file boundaries, stop and split into a separate tracked change.
5. If verification fails post-batch and root cause is unclear, revert the batch and re-scope.
<!-- /ANCHOR:rollback-boundaries -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification-strategy -->
## 19. VERIFICATION STRATEGY

### Verification Principles
- Verify at the smallest impacted scope first, then at integration scope.
- Use existing project checks; do not invent broad new gates inside this mission.
- Treat failing verification as a blocker for completion claims.

### Required Verification Sequence
1. Run language/tool-specific checks for touched areas.
2. Run impacted test suites or command-level reproducible checks.
3. Confirm no contract/behavior drift on critical execution paths.
4. Capture evidence per batch before moving to next batch.

### Completion Gate
- Completion is valid only when all P0 requirements are met and verification evidence is available for every changed batch.
