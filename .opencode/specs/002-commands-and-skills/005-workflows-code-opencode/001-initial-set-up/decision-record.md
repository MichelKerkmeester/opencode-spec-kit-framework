## ADR-001: Simplified Structure (No Phase Routing)

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-metadata -->
### Metadata

| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-03 |
| **Deciders** | User, AI (planning session) |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Context

The existing `workflows-code` skill has a complex 4-phase routing system (Research → Implementation → Debugging → Verification) designed for full frontend development lifecycle management. This new skill is intended only for code style standards, not development workflow orchestration.

### Constraints
- Must differentiate clearly from workflows-code
- Must load quickly (minimal file count)
- Must be maintainable (simpler structure = easier updates)
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Remove all phase routing and create a flat reference-based structure.

**Details**: The skill will have a simple SKILL.md orchestrator that loads references directly without phase detection. No routing logic, no conditional resource loading based on development stage.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Flat structure (Chosen)** | Simple, fast, clear purpose | Cannot orchestrate workflows | 9/10 |
| Full phase routing | Consistent with workflows-code | Overkill, confusing overlap | 4/10 |
| Minimal single-file | Simplest possible | Limited expandability | 6/10 |

**Why Chosen**: The flat structure provides the right balance of simplicity and extensibility. A single-file approach would limit future growth, while full phase routing would create confusion with workflows-code.

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Standards gap exists; developers infer patterns |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered 3 alternatives with trade-offs |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Flat structure is simplest that meets requirements |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly addresses code consistency goal |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Structure allows future expansion via references/ |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Simpler skill (~7 files vs ~50 in workflows-code)
- Faster activation (no phase detection overhead)
- Clear purpose differentiation from workflows-code
- Easier to maintain and update

**Negative**:
- Cannot handle development lifecycle - Mitigation: By design; use workflows-code for lifecycle

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep to add phases | M | Document strict scope boundary |
| Confusion with workflows-code | L | Distinct keywords, clear differentiation |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->

## ADR-002: Naming Convention (snake_case + camelCase Aliases)

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-metadata -->
### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-03 |
| **Deciders** | User, AI (planning session) |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->
### Context

Analysis of the OpenCode codebase revealed mixed naming conventions:
- Newer code uses `snake_case` for functions (e.g., `handle_memory_search`, `extract_files_from_data`)
- Older code uses `camelCase` (e.g., `sanitizePath`, `getPathBasename`)
- The codebase is transitioning from camelCase to snake_case

Breaking backward compatibility would cause significant churn in existing code.

### Constraints
- Must not break existing code
- Must establish clear convention for new code
- Must support gradual migration
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Document `snake_case` as the primary convention with `camelCase` aliases for backward compatibility.

**Details**:
1. New functions should use `snake_case`
2. Exports should provide both naming styles
3. Existing `camelCase` code continues to work via aliases
4. Document the dual-export pattern as standard practice
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **snake_case + aliases (Chosen)** | No breaking changes, clear migration path | Larger exports | 9/10 |
| Pure snake_case | Consistent | Breaks existing code | 3/10 |
| Pure camelCase | No migration needed | Against transition direction | 4/10 |
| No convention | No enforcement overhead | Continued inconsistency | 2/10 |

**Why Chosen**: This approach respects existing code while establishing a clear direction for new code. The dual-export pattern is already used in several files (e.g., `config.js:167-183`).

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Codebase has naming inconsistency |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered 4 alternatives |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Minimal change that achieves consistency |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Enables consistent naming going forward |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Supports gradual deprecation of aliases |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- New code uses consistent `snake_case`
- Existing code continues to work
- Clear migration path documented
- Aligns with existing transition direction

**Negative**:
- Larger export blocks - Mitigation: Acceptable trade-off for compatibility
- Dual naming may confuse newcomers - Mitigation: Document clearly in style guide

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Aliases never removed | L | Document as "deprecated, for compatibility" |
| Mixed usage continues | M | Enforce snake_case in reviews |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->

|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-04 |
| **Deciders** | User, AI (5-agent parallel research) |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->
### Context

The original specification covered JavaScript/Node.js only. However, comprehensive codebase analysis revealed significant multi-language code:
- **206+ JavaScript files** in system-spec-kit
- **10+ Python files** including skill_advisor.py, validators
- **60+ Shell scripts** for automation and validation
- **3+ JSONC configuration files**

All these languages lack formalized style guidance, leading to inconsistencies.

### Constraints
- Must not break existing JavaScript patterns
- Must support gradual adoption across languages
- Must maintain clear differentiation from workflows-code (browser/web)
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Expand skill scope from JavaScript-only to cover all 4 OpenCode system languages: JavaScript, Python, Shell, JSON/JSONC.

**Details**:
- Create language-specific reference folders (`references/javascript/`, `references/python/`, etc.)
- Create shared folder for universal patterns (`references/shared/`)
- Implement language detection routing in SKILL.md
- Create per-language checklists plus universal checklist
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Multi-language (Chosen)** | Comprehensive coverage, unified skill | More files, higher complexity | 9/10 |
| JavaScript-only (original) | Simple, focused | Ignores 70+ non-JS files | 4/10 |
| Separate skills per language | Clear separation | Discovery overhead, fragmentation | 5/10 |
| Add languages incrementally | Lower initial effort | Delays comprehensive coverage | 6/10 |

**Why Chosen**: The codebase reality demands multi-language support. A unified skill with clear routing is more maintainable than fragmented skills.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-five-checks -->
### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | 70+ non-JS files exist without guidance |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered 4 alternatives |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Covers all current OpenCode languages |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Enables consistent multi-language development |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Architecture supports adding TypeScript/Go later |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Comprehensive coverage of actual codebase
- Single skill for all OpenCode system code
- Shared patterns reduce duplication
- Clear language routing

**Negative**:
- Increased file count (5 → 19) - Mitigation: Organized folder structure
- Higher initial effort - Mitigation: Parallel implementation possible

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | M | Strict language boundary (no TypeScript yet) |
| Maintenance overhead | M | Shared patterns reduce duplication |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-consequences -->

| **Deciders** | AI (architecture agent) |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-context -->
### Context

With multi-language support, SKILL.md needs activation logic to route queries to the appropriate language reference. The routing must be deterministic, fast, and have a clear fallback.

### Constraints
- Must work without requiring user to specify language
- Must handle ambiguous cases gracefully
- Must not require re-invocation on wrong guess
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Implement three-tier detection: File Extension → Keywords → User Prompt.

**Details**:
```
1. FILE EXTENSION (highest priority):
   .js, .mjs, .cjs → JavaScript
   .py → Python
   .sh, .bash → Shell
   .json, .jsonc → Config

2. KEYWORDS (if no file context):
   "node", "npm", "commonjs" → JavaScript
   "python", "pip", "pytest" → Python
   "bash", "shell", "shebang" → Shell
   "json", "jsonc", "config" → Config

3. USER PROMPT (fallback):
   "Which language are you working with? (js/py/sh/json)"
```
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Extension → Keywords → Prompt (Chosen)** | Deterministic, graceful fallback | Requires user input in edge cases | 9/10 |
| Keywords only | Simpler | Ambiguous, may misroute | 5/10 |
| Always ask user | Never misroutes | Annoying, slow | 4/10 |
| ML-based detection | Intelligent | Overkill, unpredictable | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Extension-first is highly accurate, keywords cover common queries, and user prompt ensures correct routing in edge cases.

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Multi-language requires routing |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered 4 approaches |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Covers all detection scenarios |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Fast, accurate routing |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Can add new extensions/keywords |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-004-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Deterministic routing (no guessing)
- Fast (extension check is O(1))
- User always gets correct reference

**Negative**:
- May prompt user in ambiguous cases - Mitigation: Rare, acceptable trade-off

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| New language not detected | L | Add to extension/keyword maps |
| Keyword conflicts | L | Extension takes priority |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-004-consequences -->

## ADR-005: Shared Patterns vs Language-Specific

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-metadata -->
### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-04 |
| **Deciders** | AI (architecture agent) |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-metadata -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-context -->
### Context

Some code patterns are universal across languages (e.g., "comments should explain WHY not WHAT"), while others are language-specific (e.g., `set -euo pipefail` for Shell). The reference structure must balance:
- DRY principle (don't repeat universal patterns)
- Easy lookup (don't force cross-referencing)

### Constraints
- Universal patterns should be stated once
- Language-specific lookups should not require reading universal docs first
- Structure should be intuitive for first-time users
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Hybrid approach with `shared/` folder for principles and language folders for implementation details.

**Details**:
```
references/
├── shared/
│   ├── universal_patterns.md    # Naming PRINCIPLES, commenting PHILOSOPHY
│   └── code_organization.md     # File structure CONCEPTS
├── javascript/
│   ├── style_guide.md           # JS-specific IMPLEMENTATION of principles
│   ├── quality_standards.md     # JS-specific patterns
│   └── quick_reference.md       # JS cheat sheet (self-contained)
├── python/...
├── shell/...
└── config/...
```

**Key insight**: Quick references are SELF-CONTAINED (copy-paste ready). Style guides REFERENCE shared principles but include all necessary details.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Hybrid (Chosen)** | DRY + fast lookup | Slightly more files | 9/10 |
| All in one file per language | Self-contained | Duplication, large files | 6/10 |
| Topic-based (naming.md with all languages) | Maximum DRY | Hard to find language-specific info | 4/10 |
| Pure shared + delta per language | Minimal duplication | Requires cross-referencing | 5/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Hybrid provides the best balance. Developers working on Python don't need to read JavaScript patterns, but universal principles are stated once.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-005-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Universal principles stated once (DRY)
- Language-specific lookups are fast
- Quick references are self-contained
- Easy to add new languages

**Negative**:
- More files than single-file approach - Mitigation: Clear folder structure
- Some cross-referencing needed - Mitigation: Minimal, only for deep principles

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Shared patterns drift from language-specific | L | Review during updates |
| Users miss shared docs | M | SKILL.md always loads shared + language |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-005-consequences -->
