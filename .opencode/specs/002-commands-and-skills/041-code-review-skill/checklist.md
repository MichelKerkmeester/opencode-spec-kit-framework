# Verification Checklist: sk-code--review Promotion

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

## 1. OVERVIEW

Verification matrix for completion evidence across rename, contract wiring, routing behavior, and spec closure.
---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Required for implementation closure |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR be documented with explicit rationale |
| **[P2]** | Optional | May defer with justification |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Scope and file list established in `spec.md` [Evidence: see verification notes]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Phase plan captured in `plan.md` [Evidence: see verification notes]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Execution tasks captured in `tasks.md` [Evidence: see verification notes]
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

## P0 Requirement Evidence

- [x] CHK-100 [P0] REQ-001 hard rename completed [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `ls -la .opencode/skill | rg "sk-code--review"` -> `sk-code--review` present; root artifact removed (`legacy-single-hyphen-review.zip` deleted).

- [x] CHK-101 [P0] REQ-002 router rebuilt to standards parity [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `rg -n "Resource Domains|Resource Loading Levels|Smart Router Pseudocode|Precedence Matrix|Unknown Fallback Checklist|RELATED RESOURCES" .opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md`.

- [x] CHK-102 [P0] REQ-003 runtime contract updated in agents/orchestrators [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `rg -n "sk-code--review|baseline\+overlay|overlay" .opencode/agent/review.md .opencode/agent/chatgpt/review.md .opencode/agent/orchestrate.md .opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md .gemini/agents/review.md .gemini/agents/orchestrate.md .claude/agents/review.md .claude/agents/orchestrate.md .codex/agents/review.toml .codex/agents/orchestrate.toml`.

- [x] CHK-103 [P0] REQ-004 all 18 command YAML review dispatch blocks updated [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `rg -n "standards_contract|baseline: \"sk-code--review\""` across all 18 listed YAML assets returned matches for each file.

- [x] CHK-104 [P0] REQ-005 review-intent routing updated [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence:
  - `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "review this PR for race conditions and auth bugs" --threshold 0.8` -> top `sk-code--review`.
  - `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "help me rebase and split commits" --threshold 0.8` -> top `sk-git`.
  - `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "visual review of architecture diff" --threshold 0.8` -> top `sk-visual-explainer` with `sk-code--review` as secondary contender.

---

## P1 Requirement Evidence

- [x] CHK-110 [P1] REQ-006 skill indexes updated [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `.opencode/skill/README.md` and `.opencode/README.md` now include `sk-code--review` and 11-skill counts.

- [x] CHK-111 [P1] REQ-007 spec docs synchronized [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md` updated for implemented scope and results.

- [x] CHK-112 [P1] REQ-008 validation outcomes captured [Evidence: see verification notes]  
  Evidence:
  - `quick_validate.py` -> FAIL (`Name 'sk-code--review' cannot contain consecutive hyphens`).
  - `package_skill.py` -> FAIL (same validator rule).
  - Existing same failure reproduced against `.opencode/skill/sk-code--web`, confirming validator mismatch with established `sk-code--*` naming convention.
