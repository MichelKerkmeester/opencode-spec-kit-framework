As @write agent, generate one complete standalone HTML file for a documentation section layout variant.

TASK
- Section key: setup-and-usage
- Variant: v2
- Direction: Decision-First Config
- Direction intent: Mode selection first, then tailored config and commands.
- Section purpose: Detailed setup and practical usage section with config and command examples.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
1) Adhere to style tokens and variables from supplied files (colors, typography, layout).
2) Keep visual style non-flashy, calm, and deliberate.
3) Allow meaningful structural divergence from the current baseline layout.
4) Produce desktop + mobile responsive behavior.
5) Include reduced-motion support and dual-theme compatibility signals.
6) Use semantic structure and keep the section readable/scannable.
7) You are NOT constrained to existing component composition patterns.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return ONLY raw HTML (no markdown fences, no explanation).
- Full standalone HTML document is required.
- Keep placeholder pattern style compatible with template defaults where useful.

UNIQUENESS CONTROLS
- Make this variant materially different in at least 3 axes:
  information flow, container strategy, grouping logic, emphasis model, or navigation treatment.
- Do not do color-only or icon-only changes.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- Avoid aggressive visual effects.
- Avoid decorative noise.
- Maintain clear hierarchy and implementation practicality.
