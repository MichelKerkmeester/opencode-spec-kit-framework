# Decision Record: SK-Doc-Visual Additional Extraction (Phase 002)

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001 -->
## ADR-001: Use Source-Anchored Extraction and Deterministic Preview Naming

### Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-28 |
| **Deciders** | Michel Kerkmeester, OpenCode Agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Context
Phase 001 established initial section/component previews and documented the design system baseline.
Phase 002 expanded coverage with additional sections/components, then reduced overlap by consolidating many similar section templates.
Without fixed extraction anchors and naming conventions, implementation will likely drift from the canonical source template.

### Constraints
- Canonical source remains `.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual/assets/templates/readme-guide-v2.html`.
- Existing previews already standardize imports to `../variables/*` and `../variables/template-defaults.js`.
- Consolidation must preserve required section anchors and reusable placeholder defaults.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision
**We chose**: Extract all remaining targets using line-cited source anchors and deterministic file names aligned to existing preview patterns.

**How it works**: Each section target maps to one `*-section.html` output file, and each component target maps to one standalone component preview file.
All future files inherit the same base scaffold used by current previews, and interaction contracts are preserved for `scroll-progress` and copy-code behavior.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Source-anchored deterministic extraction (chosen)** | Auditable, reproducible, aligned with existing conventions | Requires up-front matrix maintenance if source shifts | 9/10 |
| Visual-only extraction without line anchors | Fast initial drafting | High drift risk, harder review traceability | 4/10 |
| Automated bulk slicing script | Can accelerate volume extraction | Risky for interaction contracts and semantic grouping | 6/10 |

**Why this one**: It provides the highest fidelity and reviewability while matching how existing previews were prepared.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences
**What improves**:
- Implementation can proceed file-by-file without re-discovery overhead.
- Reviewers can verify each output against exact source line evidence.
- Naming consistency reduces maintenance friction across section/component assets.

**What it costs**:
- The extraction matrix must be refreshed if source line positions move.
  Mitigation: include source revalidation as the first setup task.

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Source edits invalidate line references | Medium | Re-run grep anchors before implementation starts. |
| Interaction behaviors are under-extracted | Medium | Require script-contract checks for copy-code and scroll-progress. |
| Scope creep into implementation during plan phase | Medium | Keep implementation tasks/checklist items pending until execution phase. |

### Five Checks Evaluation
| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Additional targets are currently uncovered by standalone previews. |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Compared source-anchored, visual-only, and scripted extraction approaches. |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Naming + source anchors + scaffold contract fully cover planning needs. |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Goal is reproducible extraction planning, not runtime refactor. |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Plan scales to future sections/components using same pattern. |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-impl -->
### Implementation
**What changes**:
- Phase docs contain extraction matrices, execution sequencing, implementation evidence, and consolidation outcomes.
- Implementation created 5 component previews and moved section assets to an 8-file consolidated library.

**How to roll back**:
1. Revert files in `specs/002-commands-and-skills/046-sk-doc-visual-design-system/002-component-creation/`.
2. Restore prior phase state from git history.
3. Re-run validation before reattempting planning updates.

## ADR-002: Consolidate Overlapping Section Templates into Generic Reusable Blocks

### Metadata
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-28 |
| **Deciders** | Michel Kerkmeester, OpenCode Agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->
### Context
After extraction, section previews exhibited significant overlap (similar tables, code-window blocks, and support content).
Maintaining many near-duplicate files increases upkeep cost and weakens reuse value.

### Constraints
- Preserve the shared scaffold and dependency imports.
- Keep final section set semantically complete for README-style composition.
- Avoid product-specific hard-coding in consolidated sections.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision
**We chose**: Merge overlapping sections into three generic blocks:
- `operations-overview-section.html`
- `setup-and-usage-section.html`
- `support-section.html`

The final section library remains eight files total, balancing reuse and semantic coverage.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Consolidate to 8 sections (chosen)** | Lower maintenance, clearer reusable primitives | Some specificity moved from file names to placeholders | 9/10 |
| Keep all extracted sections separate | Maximum one-to-one source mapping | High duplication and maintenance burden | 5/10 |
| Reduce to 4 sections | Very low maintenance | Over-compression and weaker semantic clarity | 6/10 |
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences
**What improves**:
- Fewer unique templates to maintain.
- Better generic reuse for future README-like outputs.

**What to watch**:
- Manual browser parity checks are still required for full closeout.

### Implementation
Merged and removed redundant section files, then synchronized skill/command references to the consolidated anchor model.
