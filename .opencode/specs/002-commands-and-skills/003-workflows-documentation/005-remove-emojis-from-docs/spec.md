# Feature Specification: Remove Emojis from All Documentation

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Remove all H2 heading emojis and TOC entry emojis from 287 markdown files across the `.opencode/` directory, aligning the entire codebase with the updated workflows-documentation v1.0.7.0 standard which no longer enforces emoji usage. The workflows-documentation skill itself was already updated (Phase 0). This spec covers every remaining skill, agent, command, README and reference file.

**Key Decisions**: Regex-based batch stripping via parallel AI agents organized by component group. Semantic H3 emojis (RULES sections) preserved. AGENTS.md and repo root README.md exempt.

**Critical Dependencies**: workflows-documentation v1.0.7.0 must be merged first (completed). Validation engine already updated to not enforce emojis.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

The workflows-documentation skill (v1.0.7.0) no longer enforces emojis in H2 headings. However, 287 files across the `.opencode/` directory still contain emoji H2 headings (pattern: `## N. EMOJI TITLE`) from the previous standard. This creates inconsistency: new documents are created without emojis while existing documents retain them. Additionally, emojis consume tokens in AI context windows without adding semantic value to section headings.

### Purpose

Strip all H2 heading emojis and TOC entry emojis from every markdown file in `.opencode/` (except exempt files), achieving 100% alignment with the updated documentation standard. Zero emoji H2 headings should remain after completion.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

- Strip emojis from H2 headings (`## N. EMOJI TITLE` to `## N. TITLE`) in all 287 identified files
- Strip emojis from TOC entries (`[N. EMOJI TITLE]` to `[N. TITLE]`) where present
- Strip emojis from H2 headings inside fenced code block examples (template examples showing `## N. EMOJI TITLE`)
- Update any inline text that references "emoji" as a required format element
- Preserve semantic H3 emojis in RULES sections (only in RULES sections)
- Verify all files pass `validate_document.py` after changes

### Out of Scope

- `AGENTS.md` at repo root (exempt, keeps emojis)
- `README.md` at repo root (exempt, keeps emojis)
- `workflows-documentation` skill folder (already completed in v1.0.7.0)
- Body-text emojis (status indicators, bullet markers, inline decorators)
- H3/H4/H5/H6 heading emojis outside of the `## N. EMOJI` pattern
- Files inside `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, `venv/`
- Spec folder `scratch/` and `z_archive/` directories (low priority, Phase 12)

- **SC-003**: `validate_document.py` passes (exit 0) on all README and SKILL files
- **SC-004**: No semantic H3 emojis were accidentally removed from RULES sections
- **SC-005**: Body-text emojis (status indicators, bullet markers) remain untouched

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | workflows-documentation v1.0.7.0 merged | Validation would fail without updated rules | Already completed |
| Risk | Accidental removal of semantic H3 emojis | RULES sections lose functional signaling | Regex targets only `## N. EMOJI` pattern, not `### EMOJI` |
| Risk | Body-text emojis removed | Status indicators and decorators lost | Regex scoped to H2 heading lines only |
| Risk | TOC anchor slugs break after emoji removal | Internal navigation broken | Anchors use slugified text without emojis already |
| Risk | Code block examples not updated | Templates show outdated format | Dedicated pass for fenced code block content |
| Risk | Agent/command files have non-standard H2 format | Some files use `## EMOJI TITLE` without numbers | Include unnumbered H2 emoji pattern in regex |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Each agent phase should complete within 5 minutes (parallel execution)
- **NFR-P02**: Total wall-clock time under 30 minutes for all 287 files

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Each file must be read before editing (no blind writes)
- **NFR-R02**: Each modified file must be verified after editing (grep for remaining emojis)

### Safety
- **NFR-S01**: No file deletion (modify only)
- **NFR-S02**: Git status checked before and after each phase
- **NFR-S03**: Exempt files (AGENTS.md, root README.md) must never be modified
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Emoji Variations
- Multi-byte emojis with variation selectors (e.g., `⚙️` = `⚙` + `U+FE0F`)
- Emojis at different positions: `## EMOJI TITLE` (no number), `## N. EMOJI TITLE` (numbered)
- Multiple emojis in one heading: `## 1. EMOJI1 EMOJI2 TITLE` (strip all)

### Content Boundaries
- Emojis inside fenced code blocks showing template format (must be stripped)
- Emojis in inline code backticks describing format (may reference old format)
- Emojis in table cells describing heading format (update to new format)

### File Types
- Agent files use frontmatter + H2 sections (different structure from skills)
- Command files use frontmatter + H2 sections with `## N. EMOJI SECTION-NAME`
- Some READMEs have no numbered H2s but still have `## EMOJI TITLE`

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Consistent Documentation (Priority: P0)

**As a** developer reading OpenCode documentation, **I want** consistent heading formatting without emojis, **so that** I can quickly scan documents without visual noise.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given any `.md` file in `.opencode/`, When I open it, Then no H2 heading contains emojis
2. Given a TOC section, When I read entries, Then no entry contains emojis

### US-002: AI Context Efficiency (Priority: P1)

**As an** AI agent processing documentation, **I want** headings without decorative emojis, **so that** context window tokens are used for content rather than decorators.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a SKILL.md file, When loaded into context, Then H2 headings use `## N. TITLE` format
