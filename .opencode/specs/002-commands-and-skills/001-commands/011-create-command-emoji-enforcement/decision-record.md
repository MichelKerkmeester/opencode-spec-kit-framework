## ADR-001: Remove Emoji Validation vs. Make Configurable

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Metadata

### Context

The `/create` command currently enforces emoji usage in documentation through validation logic. Documentation standards have changed to make emoji usage optional rather than mandatory. We need to decide whether to completely remove emoji validation or make it configurable via flags/settings.

### Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing templates
- Should minimize code complexity
- Should clearly communicate new policy to users
- Must not break existing command functionality
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Completely remove emoji validation logic from the `/create` command rather than making it configurable.

**Details**: All validation functions that check for emoji presence will be removed or updated to skip emoji checks. Template files will be updated to remove emoji requirements from documentation. No configuration flags will be added. Existing emojis in templates will be preserved (cosmetic only, not enforced).

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Remove Completely** | Simple, clear signal, low maintenance | Cannot re-enable without code change | 9/10 |
| Make Configurable | Flexible, can toggle behavior | Adds complexity, unclear default, maintenance burden | 5/10 |
| Deprecation Warning | Gradual migration, user awareness | Unnecessary noise, still requires removal later | 4/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Complete removal provides the clearest signal to users that emojis are not enforced, simplifies the codebase, and eliminates ongoing maintenance of conditional validation paths. The flexibility of configuration is not needed since the policy is clear: emojis are optional.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Simpler codebase (no configuration flags or conditional logic)
- Clear communication to users (no enforcement = optional)
- Reduced maintenance burden (single code path)
- Backward compatible (existing emojis still work)

**Negative**:
- Cannot easily re-enable if policy changes - Mitigation: Policy change is deliberate; re-adding would be a new feature request with clear justification

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Policy reversal | M | Document decision clearly; require new ADR to re-add |
| User confusion | L | Update help text and documentation |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Policy has changed; enforcement is no longer aligned with standards |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered configurable approach; removal is simpler and clearer |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Simplest approach that achieves goal (remove enforcement) |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly addresses requirement to stop enforcing emojis |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Does not lock in future decisions; emojis remain usable |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- `.opencode/command/create` validation logic
- `.opencode/command/create/assets` template files
- Inline help text and documentation comments

**Rollback**: Git revert commits that removed validation; verify command behavior returns to original state

## ADR-002: Template Backward Compatibility Strategy

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->
### Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-17 |
| **Deciders** | Implementation Team |

---

### Context

Existing templates in `.opencode/command/create/assets` may contain emojis in titles and sections. We need to decide whether to remove these emojis as part of the enforcement removal or leave them in place.

### Constraints
- Must not break existing templates that users may depend on
- Should align with "no enforcement" policy
- Should minimize manual work and risk
- Should provide clear migration path
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Leave existing emojis in template files; only remove validation requirements and enforcement language.

**Details**: Emojis in existing templates will remain but will be treated as cosmetic rather than mandatory. Users can choose to keep, remove, or add emojis in their own generated content. Templates will not enforce emoji presence or absence. This allows natural gradual migration as templates are updated over time.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Leave Emojis** | Zero breaking changes, gradual migration | Some templates still have emojis | 9/10 |
| Remove All Emojis | Consistent, clear signal | Breaking change, manual work, may break user templates | 4/10 |
| Add Opt-in Flag | Flexible | Against "no enforcement" goal, adds complexity | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Leaving emojis in place ensures zero breaking changes for users who depend on existing templates. It aligns with the "optional" policy (emojis are allowed but not required). Templates will naturally update over time without forced migration.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Zero breaking changes for existing templates
- Emojis become optional/cosmetic rather than enforced
- Users have choice (keep, remove, or add emojis as desired)
- Natural migration path (templates updated over time)

**Negative**:
- Some templates still contain emojis - Mitigation: Document that emojis are cosmetic, not required

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| User confusion (some templates have emojis, some don't) | L | Document "optional" status clearly |
| Perceived inconsistency | L | Update documentation to explain gradual migration |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Avoids breaking changes while achieving policy goal |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered full removal; backward compatibility is more important |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Simplest approach that preserves existing functionality |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Aligns with "optional" policy without forced migration |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Allows natural evolution of templates over time |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-five-checks -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- Template files in `.opencode/command/create/assets` (no emoji removal)
- Documentation to clarify emojis are optional

**Rollback**: N/A (no changes to existing emojis; only validation removed)
