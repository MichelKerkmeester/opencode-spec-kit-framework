## What Was Built

Made 18 spec_kit command files (7 `.md` + 11 YAML) Codex-compatible using a three-pronged approach:

1. **Change A (Strip)**: Removed `## AGENT ROUTING` sections, dispatch templates, and `## SUB-AGENT DELEGATION` sections from all 7 `.md` command files. These sections contained `@agent` names in tables that Codex misinterpreted as dispatch instructions.

2. **Change B (Constrain)**: Added `## CONSTRAINTS` section to each of the 7 `.md` files with explicit anti-dispatch rules. Uses "DO NOT dispatch" language that Codex respects as a restriction.

3. **Change C (Restructure)**: Renamed `agent_routing` to `agent_availability` in all 11 YAML files. Removed `dispatch:` and `agent: "@xxx"` fields. Added `condition:` and `not_for:` fields. Changed YAML comments from "REFERENCE ONLY" to "AGENT AVAILABILITY (conditional)".

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Three-pronged approach (strip + constrain + restructure) | Single-pronged approaches were too weak (commenting) or too aggressive (full removal) |
| Kept `agent_availability` metadata in YAML | Full removal would break agent routing for Claude; restructured form preserves functionality |
| Removed `dispatch:` fields entirely | Imperative dispatch strings were the primary Codex trigger |
| Added `condition:` and `not_for:` fields | Non-imperative language that describes availability without triggering dispatch |
| Explicit `## CONSTRAINTS` section in `.md` | Stronger than HTML comments; Codex respects section-level constraints |
| Serial per-command execution | Safer than batch; allows verification after each command pair |

See `decision-record.md` for full ADR-001 with alternatives analysis and five checks.

## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| SC-001: agent_routing = 0 | Pass | `grep -r "agent_routing" .opencode/command/spec_kit/` returns 0 |
| SC-002: dispatch:.*@ = 0 | Pass | `grep -r "dispatch:.*@" .opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/` returns 0 |
| SC-003: AGENT ROUTING = 0 | Pass | `grep -r "## AGENT ROUTING" .opencode/command/spec_kit/*.md` returns 0 |
| SC-004: CONSTRAINTS = 7 | Pass | `grep -rl "## CONSTRAINTS" .opencode/command/spec_kit/*.md` returns 7 files |
| SC-005: agent_availability = 11 | Pass | `grep -r "agent_availability" .opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/` returns 11 files |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

None. All identified Codex dispatch vectors were addressed by the three-pronged approach. The restructured `agent_availability` metadata preserves full agent routing capability for Claude.

Two edge cases were handled correctly:
- Resume YAML files have no `agent_routing` section, so Change C was correctly skipped for those files.
- Handover has only 1 YAML file instead of the typical 2 (auto + confirm), handled as a single restructure.
