<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [ ] CHK-020 [P0] All 6 commands produce correct output in confirm mode (regression)
- [ ] CHK-021 [P0] All 6 commands produce correct output in auto mode (new feature)
- [ ] CHK-022 [P1] Auto mode output matches confirm mode output (minus confirmation pauses)
- [ ] CHK-023 [P1] Edge cases tested: missing arguments, invalid paths
- [ ] CHK-024 [P1] Orphaned create_agent.yaml bug verified fixed

<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [ ] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets in any files
- [ ] CHK-031 [P1] Phantom dispatch vulnerability eliminated (REFERENCE ONLY annotations)

<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [ ] CHK-041 [P1] Implementation-summary.md created after completion
- [ ] CHK-042 [P2] Memory context saved for future sessions

<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [ ] CHK-050 [P0] All 18 files present (6 .md + 6 _confirm.yaml + 6 _auto.yaml)
- [ ] CHK-051 [P1] No orphaned YAML files (all referenced by .md)
- [ ] CHK-052 [P1] Naming convention consistent: `create_{name}_confirm.yaml`, `create_{name}_auto.yaml`
- [ ] CHK-053 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only
- [ ] CHK-054 [P2] scratch/ cleaned before completion
