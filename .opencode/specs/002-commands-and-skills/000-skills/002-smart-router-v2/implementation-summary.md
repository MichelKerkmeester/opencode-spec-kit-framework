## What Was Built

Smart Router rollout work in this session is complete for immediate `*/SKILL.md` targets under Public and Barter skill roots, and verification artifacts are now captured in spec scratch.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `tasks.md` | Updated | Marks completed rollout tasks and verification progress for this session |
| `checklist.md` | Updated | Adds evidence-backed verification status and refreshed P0/P1/P2 counts |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Updated | Replaces scaffold state with execution evidence and outcomes |
| `scratch/smart-router-tests/run-smart-router-tests.mjs` | Created | Smart Router verification runner for SKILL.md structure and rule checks |
| `scratch/smart-router-tests/router-rules.json` | Created | Centralized routing/test rules (markers, banned phrases, heading policy) |
| `scratch/smart-router-tests/fixtures/` | Created | Fixture set for recursive discovery validation |
| `scratch/smart-router-tests/reports/latest-report.json` | Updated | Latest suite result: total 82, passed 82, failed 0 |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use weighted scoring with fallback | Improves relevance while preserving backward compatibility |
| Use depth-limited recursive discovery | Surfaces nested resources without unbounded traversal |
| Roll out Public targets before Barter targets | Reduces cross-repository coordination risk |
| Standardize Smart Routing section ordering | Ensures router pseudocode appears first and removes heading drift (`### Activation Detection` removed) |
| Remove initiative-scoped banned phrases globally | Eliminates stale phrasing and keeps routing docs aligned to current conventions |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Automated suite | Pass | `node scratch/smart-router-tests/run-smart-router-tests.mjs` -> total 82, passed 82, failed 0 |
| Report artifact | Pass | `scratch/smart-router-tests/reports/latest-report.json` confirms markers, banned phrase removal, and heading-order assertions |
| Final cleanup verification | Pass | `### Routing Reference Tables` heading scan returned zero matches across Public + Barter SKILL roots; pseudocode-first ordering still validated by 82/82 Smart Router test pass |
| Spec validation | Pass | `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/000-skills/002-smart-router-v2` -> Errors: 0, Warnings: 0 |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

Low-confidence fallback behavior and some L3 deployment/compliance checklist items remain open in `checklist.md`. These are tracked as pending follow-up verification/documentation tasks and do not block recording the completed session scope above.

Final cleanup note: this pass removed residual `### Routing Reference Tables` headings from the SKILL.md corpus (final remaining update landed in Public `system-spec-kit`) and re-confirmed that Smart Routing sections still keep router pseudocode as the first subsection.
