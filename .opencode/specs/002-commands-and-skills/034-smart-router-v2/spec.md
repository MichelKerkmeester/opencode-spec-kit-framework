## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Smart Router V2 upgrades intent classification across 10 OpenCode skill documents (8 Public, 2 Barter repositories), replacing simple first-hit keyword matching with weighted classification, adding recursive reference/asset discovery, and enabling stack/language detection for prioritized routing within skill scopes.

**Key Decisions**: Weighted keyword scoring over simple matching, skill-scoped routing (no cross-skill), recursive subdirectory discovery for references/assets.

**Critical Dependencies**: System-spec-kit templates must remain compatible, existing skill invocation patterns preserved for backward compatibility.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Current OpenCode skills use simple first-hit keyword matching for intent classification, causing premature routing decisions and inability to prioritize context-relevant resources. Skills lack recursive discovery for nested references/assets, and code workflow skills cannot detect stack/language context for optimized routing. This leads to suboptimal resource surfacing and missed relevant documentation.

### Purpose
Implement weighted keyword intent classification with recursive discovery and stack detection across 10 SKILL.md files, improving routing accuracy by 40%+ while maintaining backward compatibility with existing skill invocation patterns.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## 13. ACCEPTANCE SCENARIOS

### AS-001: Weighted Priority Wins
**Given** a user request with mixed intent terms ("debug React component performance"),
**When** weighted keyword classification runs,
**Then** the highest aggregate weighted intent route is selected (sk-code--full-stack with React stack detection).

### AS-002: Low Confidence Fallback
**Given** all candidate intent scores are below threshold (all < 0.5),
**When** classification completes,
**Then** routing falls back to legacy-safe generic behavior without blocking.

### AS-003: Recursive Discovery Enabled
**Given** nested references/assets directories (e.g., `references/backend/go/patterns/`),
**When** recursive discovery runs,
**Then** all relevant files within depth limit (3 levels) are discoverable.

### AS-004: Recursive Discovery Safe Skip
**Given** missing references/ or assets/ directories,
**When** routing behavior executes,
**Then** skill operates normally without errors (graceful degradation).

### AS-005: Stack Marker Resolution
**Given** multiple stack markers present (go.mod + package.json),
**When** stack detection runs,
**Then** documented priority order determines selected stack path (no ambiguity).

### AS-006: Cross-Repo Parity
**Given** equivalent prompts executed in Public and Barter repositories,
**When** routing decisions are made,
**Then** behavior is parity-consistent unless explicitly documented as intentional deviation.

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty keyword input: Fallback to generic skill routing without classification
- Missing references/ or assets/ directories: Skip recursive discovery gracefully

<!-- ANCHOR:user-stories -->
## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Weighted Keyword Classification (Priority: P0)

**As a** skill consumer (agent or user), **I want** intent classification to use weighted keyword scoring, **so that** routing decisions prioritize high-relevance keywords over incidental matches.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a user request "debug React component", When the sk-code--full-stack skill classifies intent, Then keywords "debug" (0.9) and "React" (0.8) score higher than "component" (0.3)
2. Given multiple keyword matches, When classification aggregates scores, Then the highest-scoring intent wins (not first-hit)
3. Given no high-confidence matches (all <0.5), When classification completes, Then fallback to generic routing without errors

---

### US-002: Recursive Reference Discovery (Priority: P0)

**As a** skill author, **I want** recursive discovery for references/ and assets/ subdirectories, **so that** deeply nested documentation surfaces automatically without manual indexing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a skill with `references/backend/go/patterns/`, When recursive discovery runs, Then all markdown files in nested paths are discoverable
2. Given max depth limit (3 levels), When discovery encounters deeper nesting, Then discovery stops gracefully at depth 3
3. Given missing references/ directory, When discovery runs, Then skill operates normally without errors

---

### US-003: Stack Detection in Code Workflows (Priority: P0)

**As a** code workflow skill, **I want** automatic stack/language detection via marker files, **so that** routing prioritizes stack-specific patterns and verification commands.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a project with `go.mod`, When sk-code--full-stack detects stack, Then Go-specific patterns load from `references/backend/go/`
2. Given multiple marker files (go.mod + package.json), When detection runs, Then priority order (documented per skill) determines primary stack
3. Given no recognized markers, When detection completes, Then generic code routing applies without blocking

---

### US-004: Backward Compatibility Preservation (Priority: P0)

**As a** system operator, **I want** Smart Router V2 to maintain existing skill invocation patterns, **so that** agent routing and user commands continue working without migration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given existing skill invocation via AGENTS.md, When Smart Router V2 deploys, Then all agent routing continues working without changes
2. Given user commands (e.g., `/spec_kit:plan`), When commands execute, Then skill routing behavior matches pre-upgrade expectations
3. Given skill-specific constraints (e.g., workflows-git read-only), When new routing applies, Then existing constraints remain enforced

---

### US-005: Consistent Scoring Guidelines (Priority: P1)

**As a** skill author, **I want** documented weighted scoring guidelines (0.1-1.0 scale), **so that** keyword weights are consistent and predictable across all skills.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given scoring guidelines in decision-record.md, When authors assign weights, Then guidelines provide clear thresholds (0.8-1.0 = primary, 0.5-0.7 = secondary, 0.1-0.4 = tertiary)
2. Given peer review process, When weights are assigned, Then reviewers validate consistency with guidelines
3. Given unclear classification, When authors document weights, Then rationale explains scoring choices

---

### US-006: Routing Accuracy Verification (Priority: P1)

**As a** QA tester, **I want** routing accuracy improvement measurable via intent classification hit rate, **so that** Smart Router V2 demonstrates quantifiable improvement over first-hit matching.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given baseline hit rate (pre-upgrade), When Smart Router V2 deploys, Then post-upgrade hit rate improves by 40%+ on test cases
2. Given test corpus of user requests, When classification runs, Then accuracy metrics are logged for analysis
3. Given false positives/negatives, When testing completes, Then findings inform weighted scoring adjustments
