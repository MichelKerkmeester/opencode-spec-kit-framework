<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized for Smart Router V2 scope [Files: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Documentation intent and status are explicit for documentation-only phase
- [ ] CHK-042 [P2] Related READMEs updated if rollout introduces visible usage changes
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] No temporary artifacts in spec root
- [ ] CHK-051 [P1] Any scratch artifacts cleaned before completion claim

<!-- ANCHOR:arch-verify -->
## L3+: ARCHITECTURE VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-100 [P0] Architecture decisions documented in decision-record.md [File: `decision-record.md`]
- [x] CHK-101 [P1] ADR has status and decision metadata

<!-- ANCHOR:perf-verify -->
## L3+: PERFORMANCE VERIFICATION

- [ ] CHK-110 [P1] Routing latency target met for weighted classification
- [ ] CHK-111 [P1] Discovery traversal target met for recursive scan
- [ ] CHK-112 [P2] Stress scenarios executed for dense keyword prompts
- [ ] CHK-113 [P2] Performance verification notes documented
<!-- /ANCHOR:perf-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->
## L3+: DEPLOYMENT READINESS

- [ ] CHK-120 [P0] Rollback procedure documented and tested against one failed scenario
- [ ] CHK-121 [P0] Release gating/flag strategy documented if phased enablement is needed
- [ ] CHK-122 [P1] Monitoring/alerting implications documented for routing quality regressions
- [ ] CHK-123 [P1] Runbook created for rollout execution
- [ ] CHK-124 [P2] Deployment runbook reviewed by peer
<!-- /ANCHOR:deploy-ready -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->
## L3+: COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

- [ ] CHK-130 [P1] Security review completed for safe fallback and constraint preservation
- [ ] CHK-131 [P1] Cross-repository policy compatibility verified (Public + Barter)
- [ ] CHK-132 [P2] Threat model notes captured for prompt-classification misuse scenarios
- [ ] CHK-133 [P2] Data handling requirements remain unchanged and documented
<!-- /ANCHOR:compliance-verify -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs-verify -->
## L3+: DOCUMENTATION VERIFICATION

- [x] CHK-140 [P1] Level 3 spec documents synchronized for this phase
- [x] CHK-141 [P1] Target SKILL.md docs synchronized after implementation phase [Evidence: `scratch/smart-router-tests/reports/latest-report.json` scannedSkills + assertions]
Final cleanup evidence (2026-02-17): `grep -n "^### Routing Reference Tables$"` returned no matches in both `Public/.opencode/skill/**/SKILL.md` and `Barter/coder/.opencode/skill/**/SKILL.md`; `node scratch/smart-router-tests/run-smart-router-tests.mjs` remained green (82/82 pass), confirming pseudocode-first Smart Routing assertions still hold.
- [ ] CHK-142 [P2] User-facing usage guidance updated where needed
- [ ] CHK-143 [P2] Knowledge transfer notes captured for maintainers
