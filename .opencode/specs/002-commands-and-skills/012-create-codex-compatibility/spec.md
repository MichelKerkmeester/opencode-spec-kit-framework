# Feature Specification: Create Commands Codex Compatibility

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Codex (OpenAI's coding agent) misinterprets agent routing metadata in `/create` command `.md` and `.yaml` files as dispatch instructions, causing unintended agent invocations. This spec applied the same three-pronged compatibility strategy from spec 010 (spec_kit commands) to all 20 create command files, and additionally cleaned up stale emoji optionality language aligned with spec 011.

**Key Decisions**: Reuse spec 010 three-pronged approach for consistency; bundle emoji cleanup to avoid revisiting 14 YAML files in a separate pass.

**Critical Dependencies**: Write access to `.opencode/command/create/` and `.opencode/command/create/assets/` directories. Symlink `.claude/commands/create` covers both locations.

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Codex misinterprets agent routing metadata in create command files in three ways:
1. `## Agent Routing` sections in `.md` files with `@agent` names in tables are read as action items
2. `dispatch:` fields in YAML files with imperative `"Task tool -> @agent..."` strings look like executable prompts
3. Weak `<!-- REFERENCE ONLY -->` HTML comment guards are ignored by Codex

This is the same root problem as spec 010 (spec_kit commands) but manifests in a lighter form across the create command infrastructure.

### Purpose
Prevent Codex from prematurely dispatching agents when reading create command files, while preserving all agent availability metadata for Claude-based workflows.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- 6 `.md` command files in `.opencode/command/create/`
- 14 `.yaml` workflow files in `.opencode/command/create/assets/`
- Three-pronged Codex compatibility approach (strip, constrain, restructure)
- Emoji optionality language cleanup (Change D, aligned with spec 011)

### Out of Scope
- spec_kit commands (handled by spec 010)
- Other command families beyond `/create`
- Runtime behavior changes (config refactoring only)
- Removing existing cosmetic emojis from templates

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | Missed agent_routing in nested YAML | Low | Comprehensive grep across all asset files |
| Risk | Breaking command functionality | Low | Changes are metadata-only, no logic changes |
| Dependency | Spec 010 approach proven | Green | Spec 010 already completed and verified |
| Dependency | Symlink covers both locations | Green | `.claude/commands/create` symlinks to `.opencode/command/create` |

## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

N/A -- This is a configuration refactoring spec with no runtime components. All changes are to static `.md` and `.yaml` files that are read at command invocation time. No performance, security, or reliability implications.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Two Complexity Levels of .md Files
- **skill.md** and **agent.md** have 3 agents each (@context, @speckit, @review) -- larger Agent Routing tables to strip, 3 YAML blocks per workflow file
- The other 4 .md files (folder_readme, install_guide, skill_asset, skill_reference) have 1 agent each (@review) -- simpler tables, 1 YAML block per workflow file

### YAML Structural Differences
- In create commands, `agent_routing:` is embedded inside individual workflow steps (better architecture than spec_kit where it was at the top level)
- `emoji_conventions:` rename to `section_icons:` only applies to folder_readme YAML files (2 of 14), not all YAML files

### Emoji Cleanup Scope
- Emoji optionality language exists in both .md and .yaml files
- Existing cosmetic emojis in template content are preserved (only enforcement/optionality language is removed)

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Create Commands Without Premature Agent Dispatch (Priority: P0)

**As a** Codex user running create commands, **I want** the command files to not contain dispatch-like agent routing metadata, **so that** Codex does not prematurely invoke agents when reading command definitions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a create command .md file, When Codex reads it, Then no `## Agent Routing` section with `@agent` names exists
2. Given a create command .md file, When Codex reads it, Then a `## CONSTRAINTS` section explicitly forbids dispatch
3. Given a create YAML workflow, When Codex reads it, Then no `dispatch:` fields with `@agent` references exist

---

### US-002: Agent Availability Metadata Preserved (Priority: P1)

**As a** command user working with Claude, **I want** agent availability information preserved in YAML workflows, **so that** the system knows which agents are available at each workflow step.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a YAML workflow file, When I inspect it, Then `agent_availability:` blocks describe available agents with conditions
2. Given the restructured metadata, When commands execute, Then agent availability is correctly referenced
