## What Was Built

Documentation closure for parent spec `038-skill-rename` and all phase subfolders was completed. This pass focused on evidence-backed completion tracking, not code implementation changes.

### Files Changed

| File Group | Action | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md` (parent) | Modified | Synchronized parent status, phase map, and verification/checklist completion state |
| `002-sk-code--web/{spec.md,plan.md,tasks.md,checklist.md}` | Modified | Promoted phase 002 from draft/pending to verified completion |
| `006-sk-visual-explainer/{spec.md,plan.md,tasks.md,checklist.md}` | Modified | Promoted phase 006 from draft/pending to verified completion |
| `003-sk-code--full-stack/checklist.md` | Modified | Closed memory-save P2 item with saved-context evidence |
| `004-sk-documentation/checklist.md` | Modified | Closed memory-save P2 item with saved-context evidence |
| `005-sk-git/checklist.md` | Modified | Closed memory-save P2 item with saved-context evidence |
| `007-mcp-chrome-devtools/checklist.md` | Modified | Closed memory-save P2 item with saved-context evidence |
| `implementation-summary.md` files (parent, phase 002, phase 006) | Created | Added missing required implementation summaries blocking recursive validation |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The closure used only verified command outputs from this session and synchronized all documentation artifacts to that evidence. Parent and child checklist summary tables and verification dates were updated to reflect completed verification state.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use provided command evidence as authoritative verification source | The user supplied verified outputs for grep closure, folder existence, advisor smoke tests, test runs, and memory saves |
| Treat memory save as complete only where evidence exists | Evidence confirms `generate-context.js` ran for parent and phases `002-007` (indexed in `#87-#93`) |
| Complete checklist items with explicit deferred rationale only when operationally unverifiable in this pass | Keeps completion truthful while honoring user request for checklist closure |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `rg -n "workflows-code--web-dev"` across active targets | PASS - no matches (`exit 1`) |
| `rg -nP "\\bworkflows-code\\b(?!--)"` across active targets | PASS - no matches (`exit 1`) |
| `ls -d .opencode/skill/workflows-* 2>/dev/null` | PASS - no legacy `workflows-*` skill directories (`exit 1`) |
| `rg -n "workflows-code|workflows-" README.md CLAUDE.md .opencode/README.md` | PASS - no root-doc legacy references (`exit 1`) |
| `python3 -m py_compile .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py` | PASS |
| `npx vitest run tests/memory-parser-readme.vitest.ts tests/skill-ref-config.vitest.ts` | PASS - `73` tests passed |
| `skill_advisor.py` smoke queries (`git commit`, `implement feature`, `create documentation`, `take screenshot`) | PASS - routed to `sk-git` (0.95), `sk-code--web` (0.80), `sk-documentation` (0.91), `mcp-chrome-devtools` (0.95) |
| Folder existence check for 7 required skill folders | PASS - all required folders present |
| Memory save via `generate-context.js` | PASS - parent + phases `002/003/004/005/006/007` saved (`#87-#93`) |
| `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/002-commands-and-skills/038-skill-rename --recursive` | PASS WITH WARNINGS - missing-summary blockers resolved; `Errors: 0`, `Warnings: 19` |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. No new implementation code was executed in this pass; this was documentation and verification-state closure only.
2. Operational checks requiring runtime deployment context remain documented as deferred where direct evidence was unavailable.
