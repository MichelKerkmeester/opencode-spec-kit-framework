## What Was Built

Phase 007 completed the Chrome DevTools migration from the legacy workflows-prefixed name to `mcp-chrome-devtools` with filesystem, changelog, and reference updates aligned to MCP naming.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/skill/mcp-chrome-devtools/` | Renamed/Updated | Canonical MCP skill folder now present with 21 files |
| `.opencode/changelog/11--mcp-chrome-devtools/` | Renamed | Changelog folder aligned with new MCP skill name |
| `.opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py` | Modified | DevTools routing now maps to `mcp-chrome-devtools` (20 entries) |
| External reference targets (agents, install docs, root docs, spec-kit refs) | Modified | Old skill-name references removed from active text targets |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery used a mechanical rename-and-verify flow: confirm new path presence and old path absence, validate file counts, verify old-name grep cleanliness across active targets, and run targeted `skill_advisor.py` smoke checks for both generic and phrase-based queries.
<!-- /ANCHOR:how-delivered -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Validate both phrase and generic devtools intents | The phase requires confidence that routing works for concrete use cases (`take screenshot`) and broad discovery (`devtools`). |
| Treat active-target old-name grep as primary completeness evidence | `rg` across active skill/agent/command/install/root targets returned no matches for `workflows-.*chrome-devtools`. |
| Close completion only after P0 checklist reaches 15/15 | Level 2 checklist policy requires all P0 checks complete before completion claim. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `find .opencode/skill/mcp-chrome-devtools -type f | wc -l` | PASS - `21` |
| Directory checks for new/old skill path | PASS - `new_skill_dir=present`, `old_skill_dir=missing` |
| Directory checks for new/old changelog path | PASS - `new_changelog_dir=present`, `old_changelog_dir=missing` |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "devtools"` | PASS - top skill `mcp-chrome-devtools` (confidence `0.95`) |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "take screenshot"` | PASS - `mcp-chrome-devtools` (confidence `0.95`, uncertainty `0.25`) |
| `rg -n "workflows-.*chrome-devtools" . --glob '!specs/**' --glob '!.opencode/changelog/**' --glob '!**/memory/**' --glob '!**/scratch/**'` | PASS - no matches (`EXIT:1`) |
| `ls -d .opencode/skill/mcp-* | sort` | PASS - includes `mcp-chrome-devtools`, `mcp-code-mode`, `mcp-figma` |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. No functional runtime tests were executed beyond rename-integrity checks and advisor smoke tests.
2. P2 memory-save checklist item is still deferred because context save was not part of this request.
