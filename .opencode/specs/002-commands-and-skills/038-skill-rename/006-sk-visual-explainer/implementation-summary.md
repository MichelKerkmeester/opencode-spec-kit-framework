<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

Phase 006 documentation closure is complete for the rename to `sk-visual-explainer`. This pass finalized phase status fields and checklist verification state using session-verified evidence.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Modified | Updated metadata and success-criteria pass status |
| `plan.md` | Modified | Marked implementation steps complete and dependency status complete |
| `tasks.md` | Modified | Marked all tasks complete |
| `checklist.md` | Modified | Closed remaining P2 memory item; updated summary/date to full completion |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Created | Added missing Level 2 implementation summary |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Closure was performed by aligning phase documentation with verified rename integrity checks, advisor routing smoke outputs, folder/file-count verification, and memory-save evidence.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep validation scoped to active runtime targets | Matches phase acceptance goals and avoids non-runtime archive noise |
| Close memory item only after script-backed save evidence | Phase 006 is included in `generate-context.js` indexed batch `#87-#93` |
| Treat checklist closure as documentation-state reconciliation | Implementation work had already been completed before this pass |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Legacy-name grep closure for phase target (`sk-visual-explainer` old-name checks) | PASS - no matches in active targets |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "take screenshot" --threshold 0.8` | PASS - MCP route unaffected (`mcp-chrome-devtools`), confirming global routing stability |
| Visual-explainer phase routing smoke (`create visual explainer`) | PASS - routes to `sk-visual-explainer` |
| Folder/file-count verification for `.opencode/skill/sk-visual-explainer` | PASS - folder exists with `22` files |
| Memory save via `generate-context.js` | PASS - phase 006 included in indexed save batch `#87-#93` |
