## What Was Built

Phase 002 documentation is now fully closed for the rename from `workflows-code--web-dev` to `sk-code--web`. This closure pass synchronized spec/plan/tasks/checklist artifacts to verified implementation evidence.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Modified | Updated metadata and success-criteria status to completed/verified |
| `plan.md` | Modified | Marked implementation phases complete and updated dependency status |
| `tasks.md` | Modified | Marked all phase tasks complete |
| `checklist.md` | Modified | Marked all P0/P1/P2 items complete with evidence and updated summary/date |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Created | Added missing Level 2 post-implementation summary |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The phase was validated using active-target grep closure, advisor routing smoke tests, folder/file-count checks, and memory-save confirmation. Those results were then propagated into all phase documents for synchronized completion state.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use active-target regex checks for both full and bare legacy names | The phase includes full-name and bare-name cleanup requirements (`workflows-code--web-dev` and bare `workflows-code`) |
| Record thresholded advisor output as acceptance evidence | Verified smoke command for this phase is `implement feature` at threshold `0.8` |
| Mark memory-save item complete only with script-backed evidence | `generate-context.js` execution for phase 002 is included in indexed batch `#87-#93` |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `rg -n "workflows-code--web-dev"` on active targets | PASS - no matches (`exit 1`) |
| `rg -nP "\\bworkflows-code\\b(?!--)"` on active targets | PASS - no matches (`exit 1`) |
| `rg --files .opencode/skill/sk-code--web | wc -l` | PASS - `51` files |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "implement feature" --threshold 0.8` | PASS - top skill `sk-code--web` (confidence `0.80`) |
| Required skill folder check | PASS - `.opencode/skill/sk-code--web` exists |
| Root/active-doc cleanup checks | PASS - no remaining legacy phase-2 name in active targets |
| Memory save via `generate-context.js` | PASS - phase 002 included in indexed save batch `#87-#93` |
