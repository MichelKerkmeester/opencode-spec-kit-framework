## What Was Built

Phase 003 is now documented as completed for the rename from `legacy full-stack skill identifier` to `sk-code--full-stack`. The completion record confirms filesystem rename, internal reference migration across the 88-file skill folder, external reference alignment, changelog directory rename, and grep-based closure checks.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `spec.md` | Verified | Completion metadata, handoff criteria, and success criteria are synchronized to completed state |
| `plan.md` | Verified | Definition of done, phased completion, and EV evidence blocks are synchronized |
| `tasks.md` | Verified | Task completion and evidence markers are synchronized |
| `checklist.md` | Modified | All P0/P1 checklist items marked complete with evidence; summary totals/date updated |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Created | Level 2 post-implementation summary for this phase |

## How It Was Delivered

The implementation itself had already been completed in the codebase. This pass reconciled phase-003 documentation to the real repository state by validating rename artifacts and then applying those results consistently across spec, plan, tasks, and checklist.

Verification was command-driven with explicit outputs captured as EV markers:
- EV-01 to EV-12 cover folder presence, file counts, old-name grep checks, `skill_advisor.py` routing lines, install-guide references, orchestrate/skill tree scans, and changelog rename status.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use EV-01..EV-12 evidence tags across all phase docs | Keeps traceability uniform across `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `checklist.md` |
| Treat active-scope grep as authoritative closure signal | `legacy full-stack skill identifier` can remain in spec/changelog history while being absent from runtime-active files |
| Keep CHK-061 (`Memory saved`) deferred | It is P2 and does not block phase completion |

| `rg -n "legacy full-stack skill identifier" .opencode/skill/sk-code--full-stack | wc -l` | PASS — `0` (EV-03) |
| `rg -n "sk-code--full-stack" .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py | wc -l` | PASS — `8` hits (EV-04) |
| `rg -n "legacy full-stack skill identifier" .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py | wc -l` | PASS — `0` hits (EV-05) |
| `rg -n "legacy full-stack skill identifier" .opencode/agent/orchestrate.md .opencode/agent/chatgpt/orchestrate.md .claude/agents/orchestrate.md .gemini/agents/orchestrate.md | wc -l` | PASS — `0` (EV-07) |
| `rg -n "legacy full-stack skill identifier" .opencode/skill --glob '!**/memory/**' --glob '!**/scratch/**' | wc -l` | PASS — `0` (EV-08) |
| `rg -n "legacy full-stack skill identifier" . --glob '!.git/**' --glob '!.opencode/specs/**' --glob '!.opencode/changelog/**' | wc -l` | PASS — `0` (EV-09) |
| Changelog directory checks for `09--sk-code--full-stack` vs `09--legacy full-stack skill identifier` | PASS — new present, old absent (EV-10) |
| `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh specs/002-commands-and-skills/038-skill-rename/003-sk-code--full-stack` | PASS — Errors: `0`, Warnings: `0` |
| `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/check-completion.sh specs/002-commands-and-skills/038-skill-rename/003-sk-code--full-stack` | PASS — `RESULT: READY FOR COMPLETION` (P0 `13/13`, P1 `9/9`, P2 `0/1` deferrable) |
