## What Was Built

Wave 2 completion documentation for Phase 001 is now finalized and aligned to verified active-path outcomes. This pass did not change implementation code; it reconciled phase tracking artifacts to the confirmed repository state for the legacy workflow-prefixed token to `sk-code--opencode` rename.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `tasks.md` | Modified | Marked all completed phase tasks `[x]`, including verification tasks and completion criteria |
| `checklist.md` | Modified | Marked all P0/P1/P2 items `[x]` with concise command-backed evidence and updated verification totals/date |
| `implementation-summary.md` | Created | Added Level 2 completion summary with changed-file inventory and verification command evidence |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery was evidence-first and active-path bounded. I re-ran the required verification commands for folder presence, folder absence, symlink targets, active-path grep closure, advisor routing smoke, and targeted regression testing, then reflected those results into `tasks.md` and `checklist.md`.

All completion claims in this phase are tied to explicit command output from the current workspace session.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep verification scope limited to the phase active-path target set | Matches phase requirements and avoids unsupported repo-wide cleanup claims |
| Re-verify provided outcomes before marking docs complete | Prevents stale status and keeps checklist evidence directly traceable |
| Mark all checklist priorities complete in this phase | P0/P1/P2 checks are all satisfied by current command evidence and no blockers remain |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `test -d .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode` plus legacy-alias absence check | PASS — canonical skill folder present, legacy alias missing |
| `find .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode -type f \| wc -l` | PASS — `35` files in renamed skill folder |
| `test -d .opencode/changelog/07--sk-code--opencode` and inverse check for old changelog path | PASS — new changelog dir present, old dir missing |
| `readlink .claude/skills/sk-code--opencode` and `readlink .gemini/skills/sk-code--opencode` | PASS — both point to `../../.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode` |
| Legacy-token `rg` scan over phase active-path target set | PASS — no matches (`rg` exit code 1) |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/scripts/skill_advisor.py "opencode standards"` | PASS — returns `sk-code--opencode` with threshold pass |
| `npm test -- tests/skill-ref-config.vitest.ts` (in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server`) | PASS — `1` file passed, `8` tests passed |
