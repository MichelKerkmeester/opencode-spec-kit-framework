# Spec: Retrieval Anchors for Skill Documentation

<!-- ANCHOR: summary -->
**Spec Folder**: `specs/002-commands-and-skills/033-anchor-implementation`  
**Level**: 3+ (Governance + Architecture)  
**Status**: Planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-17  
**Owner**: System Architecture Team
<!-- /ANCHOR: summary -->

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Current State

Skill documentation under `.opencode/skill/` lacks structured semantic anchors for retrieval operations. When skills need to be referenced, loaded, or analyzed by memory systems or AI agents, there's no standardized way to extract specific sections (overview, usage patterns, examples, rules, etc.) without parsing the entire document.

This creates several issues:

1. **Inefficient context loading**: Agents must read entire skill files even when only specific sections are needed
2. **No semantic retrieval**: Cannot query "show me all skill usage rules" or "extract examples from skills"
3. **Inconsistent memory indexing**: Skill content indexed without structural metadata
4. **Poor context budgeting**: Large skill files consume excessive tokens when only summaries needed

### Business Impact

- **Developer productivity**: Slower skill discovery and comprehension
- **Token efficiency**: Wasted context capacity on unnecessary content
- **Knowledge management**: Difficulty maintaining skill knowledge graph
- **System scalability**: Cannot efficiently scale to hundreds of skills

### Root Cause

Skills were designed before the anchor-based retrieval system (ANCHOR tags) was implemented for memory files. The current memory system's 5-state model and ANCHOR format provides structured extraction but was never extended to skill documentation.

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope

**Core Deliverables**:
1. Update three skill template files in `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/assets/opencode/`:
   - `skill_md_template.md` (main SKILL.md structure)
   - `skill_reference_template.md` (references folder docs)
   - `skill_asset_template.md` (assets folder docs)

2. Define anchor taxonomy for skill documents:
   - Summary anchors (overview, purpose)
   - Structural anchors (when-to-use, how-it-works, rules)
   - Operational anchors (examples, workflows, troubleshooting)
   - Metadata anchors (resources, dependencies, version-info)

3. Crawl and update all existing skill markdown files:
   - 9 SKILL.md files in `.opencode/skill/*/SKILL.md`
   - All `references/*.md` files per skill
   - All `assets/*.md` files per skill
   - Constitutional docs (`constitutional/*.md`)

4. Validation tooling:
   - Anchor format validation script
   - Coverage verification (% of sections anchored)
   - Syntax checker for anchor tags

**Constraints**:
- **NO memory indexing**: Skill docs remain outside memory system scope
- **NO schema changes**: Memory MCP server unchanged
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing skill loading mechanisms continue working
- **Template-first approach**: Templates updated before bulk migration

### Out of Scope

- Memory indexing of skill documentation (intentionally excluded)
- Changes to memory MCP server or database schema
- Agent routing logic modifications
- Skill invocation workflow changes
- Non-markdown files (scripts, configs)
- Legacy skill folders marked for deprecation

### Affected Systems

| System | Impact | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|
| Skill templates | High - foundation for all new skills | Medium |
| Existing skills (9 folders) | High - content structure change | Medium |
| Memory retrieval (read-only) | Low - new capability, no breaking changes | Low |
| Agent workflows | Low - transparent enhancement | Low |
| Documentation tooling | Medium - validation scripts added | Low |

### Dependencies

- `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/` templates (source of truth)
- Memory ANCHOR format specification (reference implementation)
- Python validation scripts (anchor format checking)

## 6. RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **R1**: Anchor syntax breaks Markdown rendering | Low | High | Medium | Use HTML comments format, test in preview |
| **R2**: Migration script corrupts skill files | Low | Critical | High | Mandatory backups, dry-run first, validation gates |
| **R3**: Inconsistent anchor naming across skills | Medium | Medium | Medium | Define taxonomy first, validation enforces naming |
| **R4**: Low adoption of anchors in new skills | Medium | Medium | Medium | Template examples, documentation, training |
| **R5**: Performance degradation from large anchor blocks | Low | Medium | Low | Content guidelines (max size per anchor), monitoring |
| **R6**: Rollback fails to restore original state | Low | Critical | High | Test rollback on sample, verify with diff, keep backups for 30 days |

### Mitigation Details

**R1: Anchor Syntax Breaks Markdown Rendering**
- **Strategy**: Use HTML comment format identical to memory ANCHOR tags
- **Validation**: Test in VS Code, GitHub preview, Markdown lint tools
- **Fallback**: If rendering issues found, switch to metadata blocks

**R2: Migration Script Corrupts Skill Files**
- **Strategy**: Multi-layered safety:
  1. Mandatory backup before any modification
  2. Dry-run mode shows all changes without writing
  3. Interactive mode requires per-file confirmation
  4. Validation gate after migration (rollback if fails)
- **Testing**: Corrupt file detection, diff verification, rollback dry-run

**R3: Inconsistent Anchor Naming**
- **Strategy**: 
  1. Define taxonomy first (FR-1)
  2. Validation script enforces naming conventions
  3. Migration script uses taxonomy as source of truth
- **Enforcement**: Pre-commit hook validates anchor names

**R4: Low Adoption in New Skills**
- **Strategy**:
  1. Templates include anchor examples with comments
  2. "How to use anchors" section in each template
  3. Validation script runs in CI (warnings for missing anchors)
- **Tracking**: Monthly coverage reports, trend analysis

**R5: Performance Degradation**
- **Strategy**:
  1. Content guidelines: max 500 lines per anchor block
  2. Encourage splitting large sections into multiple anchors
  3. Monitor skill load times (baseline vs post-anchor)
- **Alert threshold**: >10ms increase in load time

**R6: Rollback Fails**
- **Strategy**:
  1. Test rollback procedure on sample skill before bulk migration
  2. Verify restored files byte-identical to originals (diff)
  3. Keep backups for 30 days post-migration
  4. Document rollback procedure in runbook
- **Testing**: Automated rollback test in migration script
