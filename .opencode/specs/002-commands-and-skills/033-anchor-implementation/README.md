## KEY REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR-1**: Define anchor taxonomy (10-15 anchor types, lowercase-hyphenated)
2. **FR-2**: Update 3 skill templates with anchor examples and guidelines
3. **FR-3**: Build migration script (dry-run, interactive, batch modes with backup/rollback)
4. **FR-4**: Build validation tooling (format + coverage checks, JSON reports)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-1 Performance**: Migration script <30s per 100 files, validation <5s per skill
2. **NFR-2 Maintainability**: Identical to memory ANCHOR format, self-documenting templates
3. **NFR-3 Backward Compatibility**: Skills without anchors continue working, no API changes
4. **NFR-4 Documentation**: Migration guide, usage guidelines, troubleshooting section

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Validation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Template anchor examples | ≥3 per template | Manual count |
| SKILL.md anchor coverage | ≥80% of H2 sections | Validation script |
| Reference doc coverage | ≥60% of major sections | Validation script |
| Migration success rate | 100% (no data loss) | Automated tests |
| Validation pass rate | 100% post-migration | CI integration |
| Rollback success rate | 100% (identical to original) | Diff comparison |

## RISKS & MITIGATION

### Top 6 Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **R1**: Anchor syntax breaks Markdown | Low | High | Use HTML comments (tested), fallback to metadata |
| **R2**: Migration corrupts files | Low | Critical | Mandatory backups, dry-run, validation gates |
| **R3**: Inconsistent anchor naming | Medium | Medium | Taxonomy first, validation enforces |
| **R4**: Low adoption in new skills | Medium | Medium | Template examples, CI validation |
| **R5**: Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Content guidelines (max 500 lines/anchor) |
| **R6**: Rollback fails | Low | Critical | Test rollback, verify with diff, 30-day retention |
