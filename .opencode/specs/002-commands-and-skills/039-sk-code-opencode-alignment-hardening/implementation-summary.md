## What Was Built

The verifier is now behavior-refined and execution-safe for warning-only drift runs. The implementation reduced noisy findings, fixed known parser edge cases, and introduced a strict mode gate for CI when warning findings should fail.

### Verifier Script Changes

Updated file: `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/verify_alignment_drift.py`

Key delivered changes:
- Added `.mts` support in TypeScript coverage.
- Added `--fail-on-warn` flag for strict CI behavior.
- Default mode now passes warning-only runs and fails only on errors.
- Added root/file deduplication using realpath normalization.
- Added contextual advisory severity downgrade for archive/context/scratch/memory/research-like paths.
- Narrowed TS module-header enforcement for test-heavy and pattern-asset paths.
- Skipped JS strict-mode enforcement for `.mjs`.
- Implemented `tsconfig*.json` comment-aware fallback parse.
- Made JSONC block-comment stripping line-preserving for accurate parser line reporting.

### Test Coverage Added

Added file: `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/test_verify_alignment_drift.py`

Coverage includes:
- `.mts` discovery and rule enforcement
- overlapping root dedupe
- `tsconfig` comment handling
- JSONC line-number preservation
- `.mjs` strict-mode exception
- TS test-file header exception
- default warning-only exit behavior (exit 0)
- strict warning-fail behavior (exit 1)
- contextual downgrade behavior for integrity findings

### Documentation Updated

Updated files:
- `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/shared/alignment_verification_automation.md`
- `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md`

Documentation now describes:
- severity model (`ERROR` vs `WARN`)
- default/non-blocking warning mode
- strict mode with `--fail-on-warn`
- context-advisory downgrade policy
- refined TS/JS/JSON handling behavior

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery was completed in three stages: defect-targeted script updates, focused regression tests, and CLI + docs verification.

1. Implemented and refactored verifier logic in `verify_alignment_drift.py`.
2. Added 9 regression tests in `test_verify_alignment_drift.py` and ran them successfully.
3. Ran baseline and strict verifier commands on `.opencode` and confirmed expected pass/fail semantics.
4. Updated skill/reference documentation so usage and CI behavior match runtime output.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Add `--fail-on-warn` strict mode | Enables CI fail-fast without forcing warning failures in default developer workflows |
| Keep warning-only scans passing by default | Reduces noise-driven churn while preserving visibility of actionable findings |
| Use contextual advisory downgrade vs broad hard exclusions | Keeps findings visible in archival/context trees while preventing false build breaks |
| Add `tsconfig` comment-aware fallback | Fixes known false positive without weakening strict JSON checks for other files |
| Preserve line numbers in JSONC stripping | Keeps parser error locations actionable during remediation |

## Verification

### Validation Command Outcomes

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `python3 -m py_compile .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/verify_alignment_drift.py` | PASS |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/test_verify_alignment_drift.py` | PASS (`Ran 9 tests ... OK`) |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/verify_alignment_drift.py --root .opencode` | PASS (exit `0`) |
| `python3 .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/verify_alignment_drift.py --root .opencode --fail-on-warn` | PASS (expected fail behavior; exit `1`) |

Sandbox execution note: bytecode cache permissions can require `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/pycache` when running `py_compile` in restricted environments.

### Before/After Behavior

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Default warning-only run outcome | FAIL (non-zero when findings exist) | PASS (warning-only findings non-blocking) |
| Strict CI control | Not available | `--fail-on-warn` supported |
| Baseline scan stats | `853` scanned, `354` violations | `854` scanned, `180` findings (`0` errors, `180` warnings) |
| Strict run on same scope | N/A | FAIL as expected with `--fail-on-warn`, same findings |

### Rule Distribution Delta

| Rule ID | Before | After | Delta |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| TS-MODULE-HEADER | 193 | 32 | -161 |
| SH-STRICT-MODE | 48 | 48 | 0 |
| SH-SHEBANG | 38 | 38 | 0 |
| JS-USE-STRICT | 45 | 33 | -12 |
| PY-SHEBANG | 22 | 22 | 0 |
| PY-DOCSTRING | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| JSON-PARSE | 2 | 1 | -1 |

`tsconfig` comment false-positive is resolved (`JSON-PARSE` `2 -> 1`).

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Warnings remain** Baseline still reports `180` warnings, which are intentionally visible and non-blocking in default mode.
2. **Policy is heuristic-based** Context-advisory downgrade relies on path segmentation patterns and may need refinement for new folder conventions.
3. **Strict mode adoption is opt-in** CI must explicitly use `--fail-on-warn` to treat warnings as blocking.
