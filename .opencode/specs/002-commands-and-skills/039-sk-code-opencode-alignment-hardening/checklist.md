## 0. OVERVIEW
This document preserves the existing technical decisions and adds validator-required readme structure.

## DOCUMENT SECTIONS
Use the anchored sections below for complete details.


<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

## P0

P0 items are hard blockers. Completion claim is invalid until all P0 items are checked with evidence.

## P1

P1 items are required unless explicitly deferred with user approval and documented rationale.
