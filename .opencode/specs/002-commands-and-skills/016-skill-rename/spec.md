# Spec: workflows-documentation Skill Functional Testing

> Comprehensive functional testing of the renamed `workflows-documentation` skill (formerly `create-documentation`) to verify all features work correctly after the rename.

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## Context

The `create-documentation` skill was renamed to `workflows-documentation` to align with the naming convention of other workflow skills. This spec documents the testing effort to verify all features still function correctly.
