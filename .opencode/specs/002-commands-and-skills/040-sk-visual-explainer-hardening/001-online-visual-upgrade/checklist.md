# Verification Checklist: Online Visual Upgrade (Next Stage)

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in `spec.md` [EVIDENCE: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/041-sk-visual-explainer-hardening/001-online-visual-upgrade/spec.md`]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in `plan.md` [EVIDENCE: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/041-sk-visual-explainer-hardening/001-online-visual-upgrade/plan.md`]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available [EVIDENCE: plan dependency table + successful command execution]
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

## P0 Requirement Evidence

- [x] CHK-100 [P0] REQ-001 Routing parity primitives and router structure updated in `SKILL.md` [EVIDENCE: smart routing map + references section present in `.opencode/skill/sk-visual-explainer/SKILL.md`]
- [x] CHK-101 [P0] REQ-002 Version matrix complete with no missing pinned artifacts [EVIDENCE: `.opencode/skill/sk-visual-explainer/assets/library_versions.json` + `bash .opencode/skill/sk-visual-explainer/scripts/check-version-drift.sh` -> `Version alignment OK`]
- [x] CHK-102 [P0] REQ-003 Template modernization applied consistently across three templates [EVIDENCE: validator PASS on architecture/data-table/mermaid-flowchart templates]
- [x] CHK-103 [P0] REQ-004 Validator and drift checks enforce contract [EVIDENCE: fixture suite exits as expected; drift check pass]
- [x] CHK-104 [P0] REQ-005 `sk-documentation` touchpoint constrained to minimal scope for this workstream [EVIDENCE: updates in `skill_md_template.md` and `skill_creation.md`]

---

## P1 Requirement Evidence

- [x] CHK-110 [P1] REQ-006 Maintenance commands documented and reproducible [EVIDENCE: package/drift/fixture/template-validator commands executed successfully]
- [x] CHK-111 [P1] REQ-007 Backward compatibility/version pins captured in matrix and references [EVIDENCE: `library_versions.json`, `quick_reference.md`, `library_guide.md`]

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Modified scripts pass executable quality checks [EVIDENCE: `check-version-drift.sh`, `test-validator-fixtures.sh`, and `validate-html-output.sh` all pass]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] Validator output has no unexpected regressions [EVIDENCE: three template validation runs report PASS with 0 warnings/0 errors]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Drift checker messaging is actionable and deterministic [EVIDENCE: `ok ...` per artifact + final `Version alignment OK`]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Changes follow existing project patterns [EVIDENCE: `package_skill.py` validation PASS, one warning only (`RELATED RESOURCES`)]
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] All acceptance criteria met for delivered scope [EVIDENCE: routing/version/template/validator/touchpoint artifacts all present and validated]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual validation run complete [EVIDENCE: all requested verification commands executed on 2026-02-22]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested [EVIDENCE: fixture `minimal-pass.html` (exit 0), `missing-contrast-media.html` (exit 1)]
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Error scenarios validated [EVIDENCE: fixtures for missing color-scheme/reduced-motion/mermaid hardening/canvas fallback return expected exit 2]
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets [EVIDENCE: secret-pattern grep across touched implementation files returned no matches]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input/path validation remains safe [EVIDENCE: validator and drift scripts check files/read patterns only; no write operations to validated artifacts]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Read-only script behavior preserved [EVIDENCE: only `/tmp` cleanup (`rm -f /tmp/...`) appears in scripts]
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks/checklist synchronized [EVIDENCE: spec/plan updated to as-built artifacts: `assets/library_versions.json`, reference docs (`quick_reference.md`, `library_guide.md`, `quality_checklist.md`, `css_patterns.md`, `navigation_patterns.md`), and `scripts/check-version-drift.sh`; tasks/checklist/implementation-summary naming aligned]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Implementation summary updated with evidence [EVIDENCE: verification command outputs and scope-boundary notes added]
- [ ] CHK-042 [P2] Supplemental README updates completed if needed
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in `scratch/` only [EVIDENCE: temporary package exists at `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/041-sk-visual-explainer-hardening/001-online-visual-upgrade/scratch/sk-visual-explainer.zip`]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] `scratch/` cleaned before completion [EVIDENCE: no child-spec `scratch/` artifacts created during this closeout]
- [ ] CHK-052 [P2] Memory context saved via approved script
