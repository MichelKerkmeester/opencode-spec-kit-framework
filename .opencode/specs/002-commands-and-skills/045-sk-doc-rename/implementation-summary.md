## What Was Built

The rename implementation is now complete across the scoped repository. Canonical aliases (`sk-doc`, `sk-doc-visual`) are active in content, filesystem paths, and runtime symlink names, and the remnant policy check reports zero for all tracked legacy identifier families. You now have a clean, canonical skill namespace plus a complete forensic artifact trail in `scratch/`.

### Repo-Wide Canonical Rename Execution

Execution followed four stages: preflight capture, ordered path migration, post-order flatten correction, and final verification. The implementation generated a reproducible evidence set with baseline counts, rename map, rename log, symlink inventory, and final remnant counts. Path migration processed 17 entries, and content migration processed 330 files.

### Rename Matrix

| Migration Surface | Legacy Identifier Family | Canonical Target | Evidence |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------|
| Core skill folder | Documentation skill alias/path | `sk-doc` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:11` |
| Core skill folder | Visual-doc skill alias/path | `sk-doc-visual` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:10` |
| Runtime symlink names | Documentation skill alias | `sk-doc` | `scratch/post-path-symlinks.txt:1` |
| Runtime symlink names | Visual-doc skill alias | `sk-doc-visual` | `scratch/post-path-symlinks.txt:2` |
| Changelog namespaces | Documentation skill stream | `11--sk-doc` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:13` |
| Changelog namespaces | Visual-doc skill stream | `12--sk-doc-visual` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:12` |
| Historical spec paths | Documentation skill phase paths | Canonicalized to `.../sk-doc/...` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:8` |
| Historical spec paths | Visual-doc skill phase paths | Canonicalized to `.../sk-doc-visual/...` | `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:6` |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery used a strict evidence-first workflow. Preflight artifacts established the baseline, then ordered path migration was executed and corrected with a flatten fix where move ordering created nested leftovers. Content replacement was applied repo-wide for scoped files, and verification closed with remnant-zero checks, symlink validation, external AGENTS no-op confirmation, skill advisor smoke tests, spec validation, and strict completion validation.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep legacy tokens out of completion docs and use abstract legacy-identifier wording | Prevents accidental reintroduction of removed literals in spec documentation. |
| Use ordered rename map plus explicit rename log parity check | Guarantees deterministic and auditable path migration. |
| Apply flatten correction after initial ordered moves | Resolved nested-directory side effects without manual drift. |
| Gate external AGENTS modification behind positive match only | Enforces minimal external blast radius and preserves scope lock. |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Baseline capture (`preflight-counts.txt`, `preflight-paths.txt`, `preflight-symlinks.txt`) | PASS |
| Path rename execution log parity (`path-rename-map.tsv` vs `path-rename-log.txt`) | PASS (17 map rows, 17 log rows) |
| Post-path symlink verification (`post-path-symlinks.txt`) | PASS |
| Final remnant policy (`final-remnant-counts.txt`) | PASS (all tracked rows `0`) |
| External AGENTS verification (`Barter/coder/AGENTS.md`) | PASS (0 matches, no update) |
| Skill advisor smoke: `"create documentation"` | PASS (`sk-doc`, confidence `0.81`) |
| Skill advisor smoke: `"generate visual html"` | PASS (`sk-doc-visual`, confidence `0.95`) |
| Spec validation (`validate.sh`) | PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings) |
| Strict completion (`check-completion.sh --strict`) | PASS (all P0/P1/P2 checked) |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Historical artifact references remain discoverable inside archived files and scratch logs by design.** They are preserved as migration evidence, not active identifiers.
