# Verification Checklist: sk-doc + sk-doc-visual Repo-Wide Rename

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

## P0 Verification Items

- CHK-001, CHK-002, CHK-010, CHK-011, CHK-020, CHK-021, CHK-030, CHK-031

---

## P1 Verification Items

- CHK-003, CHK-012, CHK-013, CHK-022, CHK-023, CHK-032, CHK-040, CHK-041, CHK-050, CHK-051

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in `spec.md`. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/spec.md:1`]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach and checks (`PC-001` to `PC-006`) defined in `plan.md`. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/plan.md:1`]
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies and external conditional scope identified. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/plan.md:127`]
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Rename operations used ordered map execution with parity validation. [Evidence: `scratch/path-rename-map.tsv:1`, `scratch/path-rename-log.txt:1`, `wc -l .../path-rename-map.tsv .../path-rename-log.txt => 17 + 17`]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No syntax breakage persisted in scoped markdown docs; validation passed. [Evidence: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename => RESULT: PASSED`]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error-handling path documented for rollback/recovery. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/plan.md:145`]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Naming conventions align with canonical aliases and symlink targets. [Evidence: `scratch/post-path-symlinks.txt:1`, `scratch/post-path-symlinks.txt:4`]
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Remnant policy passed with all tracked legacy token families at zero. [Evidence: `scratch/final-remnant-counts.txt:1`, `scratch/final-remnant-counts.txt:10`]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Path/symlink migration integrity checks passed. [Evidence: `test -d .../.opencode/skill/sk-doc`, `test -d .../.opencode/skill/sk-doc-visual`, `scratch/post-path-symlinks.txt:1`]
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] External AGENTS check completed with zero matches and no update required. [Evidence: `rg -n "<legacy-doc-identifier>|<legacy-visual-doc-identifier>" "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Barter/coder/AGENTS.md" || true => no output`]
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Spec validation and strict completion checks passed. [Evidence: `validate.sh => RESULT: PASSED`, `check-completion.sh --strict => RESULT: READY FOR COMPLETION`]
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No credentials introduced during migration. [Evidence: migration was naming/path-only; no secret artifacts added in `scratch/` inventory]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] External update scope constrained to one allowed file path only. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/spec.md:67`, external check command path points only to `.../Barter/coder/AGENTS.md`]
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Shell commands used explicit paths and no unsafe glob-expansion writes. [Evidence: command log in session and artifact generation confined to spec-folder `scratch/`]
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `tasks.md` synchronized on completed scope and checks. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/spec.md:1`, `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/plan.md:1`, `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/tasks.md:1`]
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] `implementation-summary.md` updated to executed implementation narrative and verification outcomes. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/implementation-summary.md:1`]
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] Repo references aligned with canonical skill names in generated replacement list. [Evidence: `scratch/content-replacement-files.txt:1`, `wc -l .../content-replacement-files.txt => 330`]
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temporary artifacts are contained under spec-local `scratch/`. [Evidence: `.opencode/specs/002-commands-and-skills/045-sk-doc-rename/scratch/` listing]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] `scratch/` was reviewed and intentionally retained as implementation evidence bundle. [Evidence: artifact set includes preflight/map/log/post/final files; no temp files outside spec folder]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Memory save intentionally skipped per fresh-context directive. [Evidence: user requirement states no memory loading context required]
