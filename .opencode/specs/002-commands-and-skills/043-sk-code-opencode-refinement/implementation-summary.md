## What Changed and Why

This closeout shipped the approved refinement with a constrained execution footprint: one `sk-code--opencode` policy file and three `sk-code--review` alignment files. You now have explicit KISS/DRY/SOLID review routing linkage and updated review checklists that align with the policy assertions captured in the final evidence run.

### Scoped Implementation Outcomes

- Updated `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md` to keep policy and verification language aligned with the executed assertion bundle.
- Updated `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/SKILL.md` to preserve findings-first review behavior while exposing architecture-lens routing and reference mapping.
- Updated `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/code_quality_checklist.md` to ensure correctness/performance checks include KISS and DRY enforcement language used by the routing logic.
- Updated `.opencode/skill/sk-code--review/references/solid_checklist.md` to provide explicit SRP/OCP/LSP/ISP/DIP prompts for architecture-level analysis consistency.

The implementation stayed narrow on purpose so scope remained inside the four evidence-confirmed changed files, while harmonization tasks for already-compliant policy/checklist files were closed as verification-only outcomes (no net diff required; verified compliant via EVT-001/001b/001c).

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed the Level 3+ closure sequence: command-bundle assertions first, scope audit second, conditional review alignment verification third, and spec validation last. Evidence was captured in `scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md`, then mapped into `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `global-quality-sweep.md` so closeout state matches observable outputs instead of planned intent.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep closeout scope locked to the four changed implementation files | Scope integrity is preserved while allowing verification-only closure for already-compliant harmonization targets (no net diff required; EVT-001/001b/001c PASS). |
| Treat spec validation `PASSED WITH WARNINGS` as non-blocking closure input | Validation reported `Errors: 0` and one advisory warning (`SECTION_COUNTS`), so quality gates can close while documenting the warning transparently. |
| Close harmonization tasks when verification proves existing compliance | Evidence integrity is maintained by using command-backed no-net-diff closure language tied to EVT-001/001b/001c rather than inferred edits. |

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| EVT-001 policy/header/checklist assertions | PASS (including EVT-001b and EVT-001c sub-assertions) |
| EVT-003 scope audit | PASS (changed files limited to four scoped files) |
| EVT-004 optional review alignment assertions | PASS |
| Spec validation | PASS WITH WARNINGS (`Exit code: 1`, `Errors: 0`, `Warnings: 1`) |

<!-- ANCHOR:known-warnings -->
## Known Warnings

1. `SECTION_COUNTS` warning in spec validation: `Found 0 acceptance scenarios, expected at least 6 for Level 3`. This is advisory in the reported run because no validation errors were emitted.

<!-- ANCHOR:follow-up-risk-notes -->
## Follow-up Risk Notes

1. Harmonization tasks in `tasks.md` are now closed as verification-only outcomes because EVT-001/001b/001c confirmed those files were already compliant; future drift risk is managed through recurring sweep evidence rather than forced no-op edits.
2. Validation will continue returning warning-level exits until acceptance-scenario count expectations are satisfied or governance criteria are revised.
3. `sk-code--review/references/quick_reference.md` was intentionally left unchanged in this execution; monitor for terminology drift against updated checklist and SOLID references in future sweeps.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. This summary reflects documented evidence and scoped file outcomes only, including verification-based no-net-diff closures for already-compliant files.
