# Plan: Fix Download Button Transition Glitch

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## Steps
1. Add opacity-based hiding for `[data-download-success]` SVG in base state
2. Add opacity reveal in `ready` state with appropriate delay
3. Add defensive CSS for `fallback` state (mirror idle behavior)
4. Verify in browser that transition no longer shows overlap glitch
5. Verify the drawing animation still works in ready state
