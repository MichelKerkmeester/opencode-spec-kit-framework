# Implementation Summary: Form Input Components Enhancement

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## Overview

This spec folder documents the implementation of two enhanced form input components for anobel.com:

1. **Custom Select** - CMS-driven dropdown replacing Finsweet's `fs-selectcustom`
2. **File Upload** - FilePond-based file upload with Cloudflare R2 storage

**Implementation Status:** Code complete (v2.0), pending Webflow integration

<!-- ANCHOR:what-was-built -->
## What Was Built

### Part A: Custom Select Component (v2.0)

A fully accessible, CMS-driven custom select dropdown that:
- Renders options from a Webflow CMS Collection
- **Uses a readonly `<input>` element for both display AND form submission** (v2.0 change)
- Provides full keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape, Tab, Home, End)
- Implements WAI-ARIA 1.2 Combobox pattern for screen reader accessibility
- Works with the existing `form_submission.js` and `form_validation.js` systems

> **v2.0 Architecture Change:** The component no longer uses a hidden `<select>` element. Instead, a single `<input type="text" readonly>` with `[data-select="input"]` serves as both the display element and the form submission element. This simplifies the HTML structure and eliminates synchronization between display and hidden elements.

### Part B: FilePond File Upload

A compact single-file upload component that:
- Accepts PDF and Word documents only (per DR-014)
- Uploads files to Cloudflare R2 via a Worker proxy
- Stores the public R2 URL in a hidden input for form submission
- Provides Dutch language labels throughout
- Blocks form submission during active uploads

## Final Architecture

### Custom Select Flow (v2.0)

```
User clicks trigger
       ↓
Dropdown opens (JS adds .is--open)
       ↓
User selects option (click or keyboard)
       ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Update input.value (display text) │
│ 2. Set input.dataset.value (actual)  │
│ 3. Update aria-selected attributes   │
│ 4. Dispatch 'change' + 'input' events│
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
Dropdown closes, focus returns to input
       ↓
Form submission includes input value directly
```

> **Note:** No hidden `<select>` synchronization needed in v2.0!

### File Upload Flow

```
User drops/selects file
       ↓
FilePond validates (type: PDF/Word, size: <5MB)
       ↓
POST to Cloudflare Worker
       ↓
Worker uploads to R2 bucket via binding
       ↓
Worker returns public URL
       ↓
URL stored in hidden input [data-file-upload="url"]
       ↓
Form submission includes file URL
       ↓
Formspark receives clickable link in email
```

## File Inventory

### Source Files (v2.1 - Renamed 2025-01-03)

| File | Location | Lines | Size |
|------|----------|-------|------|
| Custom Select CSS | `src/1_css/form/form_select_custom.css` | 273 | 10.1 KB |
| Custom Select JS | `src/2_javascript/form/input_select.js` | 453 | 16.1 KB |
| File Upload CSS | `src/1_css/form/form_file_upload.css` | 176 | 4.2 KB |
| File Upload JS | `src/2_javascript/form/input_upload.js` | 390 | 14.3 KB |

> **Note (2025-01-03):** JS files renamed from `select_custom.js` → `input_select.js` and `file_upload.js` → `input_upload.js`. Refactored to snake_case code standards. File upload now language-agnostic with configurable labels.

### Minified Files

| File | Location | Size | Reduction |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| Custom Select JS | `src/2_javascript/z_minified/form/input_select.js` | 5.8 KB | 64% |
| File Upload JS | `src/2_javascript/z_minified/form/input_upload.js` | 5.6 KB | 61% |

### Infrastructure

| Resource | Type | URL |

| R2 Bucket | Cloudflare R2 | `uploads` |
| R2 Public URL | CDN | `https://pub-c638c7d6fac14551a3b2609c336ee4ab.r2.dev` |

<!-- ANCHOR:deviations-from-original-plan -->
## Deviations from Original Plan

### Storage Backend Evolution

The original plan specified Uploadcare (DR-008). This evolved through two revisions:

| Decision | Backend | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| DR-008 | Uploadcare | Superseded |
| DR-012 | Bunny Storage + Worker | Superseded |
| DR-013 | **Cloudflare R2 + Worker** | **Final** |

**Rationale:** Single vendor ecosystem, free egress, R2 binding simplicity.

### FilePond Configuration

The original plan included `FilePondPluginImagePreview` (DR-011). This was removed in DR-014:

- **Original:** Image preview for uploaded images
- **Final:** No image preview - compact layout for PDF/Word only

**Rationale:** Target use case is CV/resume uploads, not image uploads. Compact layout (~60-80px) preferred.

### ARIA Enhancements (Post-Plan)

Added WAI-ARIA 1.2 Combobox pattern improvements not in original spec:

- `aria-controls` linking trigger to dropdown
- `aria-activedescendant` for focused option
- `aria-selected` on options
- Unique IDs generated per instance

### Architecture Refactor (v2.0 - DR-015)

Major architecture change from hidden `<select>` to `<input>` element:

| Aspect | v1.x (Old) | v2.0 (Current) |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Display | `[data-select="display"]` div | `[data-select="input"]` input |
| Form Value | Hidden `<select>` element | Same input element |
| Sync | JS syncs options to hidden select | No sync needed |
| Elements | 3 (display + hidden select + options) | 2 (input + options) |

**Rationale:** Simpler architecture, fewer elements, no synchronization bugs, native input validation support.

## Remaining Work

### Webflow Integration Required

1. **CMS Setup**
   - Create "Form Select Options" collection
   - Add fields: Name, Slug, Category, Sort Order
   - Add sample options

2. **Component Structure (v2.0)**
   - Build Input | Select in Webflow Designer
   - **Use `<input type="text">` with `[data-select="input"]`** (not a display div!)
   - Build Input | File Upload in Webflow Designer
   - Add data attributes per `webflow-guide.md`

3. **Code Integration**
   - Add CSS to Webflow head (updated for v2.0)
   - Add JS to Webflow footer (updated for v2.0)
   - Add FilePond CDN resources

4. **Testing**
   - Functional testing
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Accessibility testing with screen reader
   - **Verify input value submits correctly in form**

## Notes

### Browser Support

Tested in modern browsers. Uses:
- ES6 Classes (IE11 not supported)
- `Array.from()`, `forEach()`, arrow functions
- CSS custom properties (variables)

### Performance Considerations

- FilePond loaded from CDN (unpkg.com) - consider self-hosting for production
- R2 public URLs have unlimited free egress
- Upload size limited to 5MB to prevent timeout issues

### Security

- R2 Worker uses binding (no API key in client code)
- CORS configured on Worker (can restrict to anobel.com)
- File type validation on both client and Worker
