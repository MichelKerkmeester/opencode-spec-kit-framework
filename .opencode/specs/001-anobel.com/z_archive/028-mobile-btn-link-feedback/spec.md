## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
On mobile/touch devices, the CSS `:active` pseudo-class fires on `touchstart` BEFORE the browser has determined whether the user is tapping or scrolling. This causes unwanted visual feedback (color changes, border changes, animations) when users scroll by touching interactive elements like buttons and link cards.

### Purpose
Eliminate unwanted active state flashes during scroll on touch devices while preserving active state feedback for intentional taps.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Wrap all `:active` CSS rules in `@media (hover: hover)` for desktop-only application
- Create JavaScript module to apply `[data-tap-active="true"]` on click for touch devices
- Add `[data-tap-active="true"]` CSS selectors with same styles as `:active`
- Update btn_main.css, btn_text_link.css, btn_nav.css, btn_cta.css, hover_state_machine.css

### Out of Scope
- Changing the visual design of active states - preserving existing styles
- Touch gesture handling beyond tap detection - using native click event
- Animation duration changes - using brief 150ms feedback window

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| src/1_css/button/btn_main.css | Modify | Wrap 14 :active rules in hover media query, add tap-active selectors |
| src/1_css/button/btn_text_link.css | Modify | Wrap 6 :active rules in hover media query, add tap-active selectors |
| src/1_css/button/btn_nav.css | Modify | Wrap 3 :active rules in hover media query, add tap-active selectors |
| src/1_css/button/btn_cta.css | Modify | Wrap :active icon swap in hover media query |
| src/1_css/link_new/hover_state_machine.css | Modify | Add desktop-only :active section, add tap-active section |
| src/2_javascript/global/mobile_tap_feedback.js | Create | JavaScript module for touch device tap feedback |

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | No active state flash during scroll on touch devices | Touching a button and scrolling does not trigger color/border change |
| REQ-002 | Active state feedback on intentional tap | Tapping a button shows the active state briefly before navigation |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-003 | Desktop behavior unchanged | Mouse click still shows :active state as before |
| REQ-004 | All button types covered | Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Warning, Nav, Text Link buttons all updated |
<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: Scrolling over buttons on mobile does not trigger any visual state change
- **SC-002**: Tapping buttons on mobile shows brief active state feedback (150ms)
- **SC-003**: Desktop hover and active states continue to work as before
<!-- /ANCHOR:success-criteria -->

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Browser support for `@media (hover: hover)` | Older browsers may not apply desktop-only styles | Fallback is acceptable - active states just won't show on desktop |
| Dependency | JavaScript execution | If JS fails to load, touch devices won't get tap feedback | Acceptable degradation - no feedback better than scroll-triggered feedback |
| Risk | Specificity conflicts | Low | New selectors use same specificity as existing :active rules |
