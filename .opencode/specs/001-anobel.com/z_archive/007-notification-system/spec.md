<!-- ANCHOR:objective -->
## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Feature
- **Tags**: notifications, cms, office-hours, webflow
- **Priority**: P1
- **Feature Branch**: `008-notification-system`
- **Created**: 2025-12-20
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Input**: User request for CMS-connected notifications in navbar and hero, with office hours integration

### Stakeholders
- Development (implementation)
- Content team (CMS management)

### Purpose
Enable content managers to display site-wide notifications (maintenance alerts, special hours) via Webflow CMS, with automatic integration to existing office hours system for holiday closures.

### Assumptions
- Webflow CMS is the content source (confirmed)
- Notifications rendered via Webflow embed connected to CMS
- Only one notification displayed at a time (highest priority)
- Positioning/placement handled in Webflow Designer (not JavaScript)
- Office hours script (`contact_office_hours.js`) already deployed and working

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope
- CMS collection "Notifications" with scheduling and display fields
- JavaScript to filter active notifications by date/priority
- localStorage dismiss tracking with configurable reset behavior
- Office hours integration via MutationObserver
- Auto-show notifications on holidays (from office hours config)
- CMS override capability for holiday notifications
- Banner notifications (navbar area)
- Toast notifications (hero area, closable)

### Out of Scope
- CSS positioning/layout (handled in Webflow Designer)
- Animation effects (static appear/disappear per user preference)
- Multiple simultaneous notifications (only highest priority shown)
- Push notifications or browser notifications
- Email/SMS notification delivery

## 3. USERS & STORIES

### User Story 1 - Content Manager Creates Notification (Priority: P0)

As a content manager, I need to create notifications in Webflow CMS so that visitors see important announcements without developer involvement.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because this is the core value proposition - CMS-driven content management.

**Independent Test**: Can create a notification in CMS, set dates, and see it appear on the live site.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I'm in Webflow CMS, **When** I create a notification with title, description, and date range, **Then** it appears on the site during that date range
2. **Given** a notification exists, **When** I set `is-active` to false, **Then** it stops displaying regardless of dates
3. **Given** multiple notifications exist, **When** they overlap in time, **Then** only the highest priority one displays

---

### User Story 2 - Visitor Dismisses Notification (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to dismiss closable notifications so they don't obstruct my browsing experience.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because dismissal is essential UX but not blocking for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can click X on a toast notification and it disappears, stays dismissed appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a closable toast notification is visible, **When** I click the X button, **Then** it disappears immediately
2. **Given** I dismissed a notification with `dismiss-behavior: day`, **When** I return the next day, **Then** the notification reappears
3. **Given** I dismissed a notification with `dismiss-behavior: session`, **When** I close and reopen the browser, **Then** the notification reappears

---

### User Story 3 - Auto-Holiday Notifications (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to see when Nobel is closed for holidays so I know not to expect service.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because it leverages existing office hours logic and provides automatic value.

**Independent Test**: On a holiday (or simulated), a notification appears without CMS entry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** today is a holiday in the office hours config, **When** no CMS notification exists for today, **Then** an auto-generated holiday notification appears
2. **Given** today is a holiday, **When** a CMS notification exists for today, **Then** the CMS notification takes precedence (override)
3. **Given** the office hours indicator shows "closed", **When** a notification has `show-when: when-closed`, **Then** that notification becomes visible

---

### User Story 4 - Banner vs Toast Display (Priority: P1)

As a content manager, I want to choose where notifications appear (navbar banner or hero toast) based on the message importance.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because display location affects user attention and message hierarchy.

**Independent Test**: Can set notification type in CMS and see it render in correct location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** notification type is "banner", **When** it's active, **Then** it displays in the navbar area
2. **Given** notification type is "toast", **When** it's active, **Then** it displays in the hero area with close button
3. **Given** notification type is "both", **When** it's active, **Then** it displays in both locations

<!-- ANCHOR:functional-requirements -->
## 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- **REQ-FUNC-001:** System MUST read notification data from Webflow CMS via DOM data attributes
- **REQ-FUNC-002:** System MUST filter notifications by current date (start-date ≤ now ≤ end-date)
- **REQ-FUNC-003:** System MUST respect `is-active` switch as manual override
- **REQ-FUNC-004:** System MUST display only the highest priority notification when multiple are active
- **REQ-FUNC-005:** System MUST support three notification types: banner, toast, both
- **REQ-FUNC-006:** System MUST track dismissals in localStorage with configurable reset behavior
- **REQ-FUNC-007:** System MUST observe office hours status changes via MutationObserver
- **REQ-FUNC-008:** System MUST auto-generate holiday notifications when no CMS override exists
- **REQ-FUNC-009:** System MUST allow CMS notifications to override auto-generated ones
- **REQ-FUNC-010:** Toast notifications MUST have a close button when `is-closable` is true

<!-- ANCHOR:non-functional-requirements -->
## 5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Notification check must complete within 50ms of page load
- **NFR-P02**: localStorage operations must not block main thread

### Usability
- **NFR-U01**: Notifications must be visible on all viewport sizes (responsive)
- **NFR-U02**: Close button must have minimum 44x44px touch target
- **NFR-U03**: Notifications must work without JavaScript (graceful degradation via CSS)

### Compatibility
- **NFR-C01**: Must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- **NFR-C02**: Must integrate with existing Webflow initialization pattern
- **NFR-C03**: Must not conflict with existing modal system or Lenis scroll

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 6. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- What happens when no notifications exist in CMS? → Nothing displays (silent)
- What happens when notification has no end-date? → Displays indefinitely until manually deactivated
- What happens when start-date is in the future? → Not displayed until start-date

### Error Scenarios
- What happens when CMS data attributes are malformed? → Skip that notification, log warning
- What happens when localStorage is unavailable? → Dismissals don't persist (show every time)

### State Transitions
- What happens when notification expires while page is open? → Remains visible until page refresh
- What happens when office hours status changes? → MutationObserver triggers re-evaluation
<!-- /ANCHOR:edge-cases -->

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 7. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Measurable Outcomes
- **SC-001**: Content manager can create and publish notification in < 2 minutes
- **SC-002**: Notification appears within 100ms of page load
- **SC-003**: Dismiss state persists correctly per configured behavior
- **SC-004**: Holiday notifications auto-appear without CMS entry

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| contact_office_hours.js | Internal | ✅ Deployed | Holiday integration won't work |
| Webflow CMS | External | ✅ Available | Cannot store notifications |
| localStorage API | Browser | ✅ Standard | Dismissals won't persist |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R-001 | CMS structure changes break parsing | High | Low | Use defensive parsing with fallbacks |
| R-002 | Office hours script not loaded first | Med | Low | Check for indicator element before observing |
