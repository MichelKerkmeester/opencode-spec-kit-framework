## What Was Built

Fixed the mobile image flickering issue in hero video cards by addressing two root causes: (1) immediate `visibility: hidden` setting during thumbnail fade transitions, and (2) lack of debouncing for viewport-triggered pause events. The fix ensures smooth transitions between thumbnail and video states during scroll.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `src/2_javascript/video/video_background_hls_hover.js` | Modified | Fixed flickering via delayed visibility and debounced pause |
| `specs/001-hero-flicker-debug/spec.md` | Created | Documented root cause analysis and solution design |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-was-built -->

<!-- ANCHOR:key-decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Delay `visibility: hidden` until after opacity transition | Prevents immediate invisibility before fade-out completes |
| 150ms debounce for offscreen pause only | Prevents rapid pause/play cycles during momentum scroll without affecting play responsiveness |
| Double-check state before applying delayed changes | Ensures stale timers don't apply incorrect state |
<!-- /ANCHOR:key-decisions -->

<!-- ANCHOR:technical-changes -->
## Technical Changes

### Fix 1: Delayed Visibility Hidden

In `show_thumbnail()` function:
- When hiding thumbnail (`visible = false`), the `visibility: hidden` is now set AFTER the opacity transition completes
- A `thumb_visibility_timer` delays the visibility change by `thumb_duration_ms + 50ms`
- Before applying, the function double-checks `data-thumb-visible` attribute hasn't changed

### Fix 2: Debounced Viewport Pause

In IntersectionObserver callback:
- Added `viewport_pause_debounce_timer` with 150ms delay for offscreen pause
- Play actions remain immediate for responsive UX
- Double-check `in_viewport` state before executing debounced pause
- Timer is cleared when viewport state changes to prevent stale actions

### Fix 3: Proper Cleanup

In master cleanup function:
- Added cleanup for both new timers (`viewport_pause_debounce_timer`, `thumb_visibility_timer`)
- Prevents memory leaks and stale timer execution after cleanup

## Verification

| Integration | Pending | Deploy to staging and test on live site |

<!-- ANCHOR:known-limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- The 150ms debounce delay means videos pause 150ms after scrolling out of viewport (imperceptible to users)
- Very fast scrolling may still show brief flicker if user scrolls back within the debounce window (edge case)

## L2: CHECKLIST COMPLETION SUMMARY

### P0 Items (Hard Blockers)

| ID | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| CHK-001 | Requirements documented | [x] | spec.md complete |
| CHK-010 | Code follows existing patterns | [x] | Matches existing timer patterns in file |
| CHK-020 | Root cause addressed | [x] | Both visibility timing and debounce issues fixed |
| CHK-021 | Manual testing pending | [ ] | Requires mobile device testing |

### P1 Items (Required)

| ID | Description | Status | Evidence/Deferral Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|--------------------------|
| CHK-003 | No new dependencies | [x] | Pure JS changes only |
| CHK-012 | Cleanup handlers added | [x] | Both timers cleared in _hoverCleanup |
| CHK-022 | State double-check added | [x] | Prevents stale timer execution |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification-evidence -->
## L2: VERIFICATION EVIDENCE

### Code Quality Evidence
- **Pattern matching**: Timer usage follows existing `hover_timer` pattern
- **Console errors**: None expected (code doesn't throw)
- **Memory leaks**: Prevented via cleanup handler additions

### Testing Evidence
- **Happy path**: Pending mobile scroll test
- **Edge cases**: Rapid scroll, momentum scroll, quick in/out of viewport
- **Error scenarios**: Timer cleanup on page navigation
