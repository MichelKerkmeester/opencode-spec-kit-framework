# Release Notes Template Optimization

## Overview

Analysis and optimization of GitHub release notes for the opencode-dev-environment repository, resulting in a standardized template that improves consistency, scanability, and information density.

## Problem Statement

The existing 16 releases show inconsistencies in:
- Version prefix usage (sometimes "v", sometimes not)
- Section structure and ordering
- Breaking change visibility
- Upgrade instruction quality
- Information density per release type

## Scope

- Analyze all 16 existing releases
- Identify patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices
- Create optimized template with modular sections
- Document version numbering conventions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Template covers all release types (major, feature, fix, docs)
- [ ] Breaking changes always visible at top
- [ ] Tables preferred over prose
- [ ] Numbered upgrade steps with code examples
- [ ] Validation checklist included

## Out of Scope

- Retroactively updating existing releases
- Automated release note generation
- CI/CD integration
