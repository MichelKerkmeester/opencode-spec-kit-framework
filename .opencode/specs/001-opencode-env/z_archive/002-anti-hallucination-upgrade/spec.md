# Anti-Hallucination Upgrade for AGENTS.md

## Overview
Integrate proven anti-hallucination patterns from external research into AGENTS.md framework.

## Source Material
External snippet introducing:
- NON-LINEAR LOGIC ENGINE framing
- E0-E3 validation levels (RAW DATA → LOGIC CHECK → CONTEXTUAL STABILITY → EVOLUTION)
- ZERO DRIFT with recursive audits
- PRE-LINGUISTIC MAPPING (intent shape detection)
- ERROR-CORRECTION with Logic-Sync halt
- NO SYCOPHANCY principle

## Scope
Enhance existing AGENTS.md sections without restructuring:
- Section 1: Quality Principles
- Section 2: Self-Verification + Common Failure Patterns
- Section 5: PRE-CHANGE VALIDATION checklist

## Out of Scope
- Boot sequence / kernel framing (stylistic, not functional)
- Turn-count based audits (impractical for AI)
- Complete E0-E3 formal levels (existing verification summary sufficient)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 5 targeted additions to existing AGENTS.md structure
- [ ] No new sections required
- [ ] Minimal cognitive overhead increase
- [ ] All changes integrate with existing gate system
