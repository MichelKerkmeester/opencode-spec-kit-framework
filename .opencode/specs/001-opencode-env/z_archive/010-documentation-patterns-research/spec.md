# Documentation and Templating Patterns Research

## Overview

This research analyzes three AI agent/MCP repositories to extract documentation patterns, template systems, and validation approaches that can improve the system-spec-kit templates.

## Objectives

1. **Specification Formats** - Understand how specs are structured across projects
2. **Template Systems** - Extract template composition and inheritance patterns
3. **Documentation Levels** - Identify progressive documentation approaches
4. **Validation and Quality** - Document completeness checks and validation rules
5. **Version Control Integration** - Changelog patterns and branch-based documentation

## Scope

### Repositories Analyzed
- [dotmd](https://github.com/inventivepotter/dotmd) - Markdown knowledge base search
- [seu-claude](https://github.com/jardhel/seu-claude) - Neuro-symbolic autonomous developer
- [drift](https://github.com/dadbodgeoff/drift) - Codebase intelligence for AI agents

### Research Deliverables
- `research.md` - Full 17-section research document
- Pattern examples and code snippets
- Recommendations for system-spec-kit improvements

## Success Criteria

- [x] All three repositories cloned and analyzed
- [x] Documentation patterns extracted and compared
- [x] Template structures documented
- [x] Validation approaches identified
- [x] Recommendations provided for system-spec-kit
