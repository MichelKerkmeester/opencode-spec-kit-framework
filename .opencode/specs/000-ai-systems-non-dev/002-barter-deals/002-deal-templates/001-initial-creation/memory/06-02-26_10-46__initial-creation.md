<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Completed the Level 3+ refinement of the Barter Deal Templates spec kit...** - Completed the Level 3+ refinement of the Barter Deal Templates spec kit (004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation).

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: The spec kit had multiple quality issues: section numbering collision in spec.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode-local/.../001-initial-creation/style-guide.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode-local/.../001-initial-creation/examples.md` - Documentation

**How to Extend**:

- Maintain consistent error handling approach

**Common Patterns**:

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Functional Transforms**: Use functional methods for data transformation

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed the Level 3+ refinement of the Barter Deal Templates spec kit (004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation). Five parallel opus agents updated 5 existing files and created 2 new files. spec.md was updated to v1.0.1 with fixed section numbering (collision at sections 3-5), added TOC, Executive Summary, NFRs, and Error Handling. plan.md was reduced by 70% (2,123 to 632 lines) by removing embedded KB content and replacing with reference tables, timeline recalibrated from 14 days to 8-10 hours, and 4 new L3+ sections added. decision-record.md had DR-009 and DR-010 strengthened (variations now description-only, DEPTH rounds now adaptive 7/10/5), 3 new DRs added (DR-011 Context Window, DR-014 Anti-AI Detection, DR-015 MVS Scope). tasks.md consolidated from 107 to 21 tasks with task-to-checklist cross-references. checklist.md populated with real completion counts. Two new L3+ artifacts created: style-guide.md (142 lines, 6 sections) and examples.md (192 lines, 3 annotated examples including anti-pattern).

**Key Outcomes**:
- Completed the Level 3+ refinement of the Barter Deal Templates spec kit...
- Fixed section numbering collision in spec.
- Reduced plan.
- Strengthened DR-009 to constrain variations to description section only - 9/6/3
- Changed DR-010 from fixed 10 rounds to adaptive 7/10/5 rounds - Constrained deal
- Added DR-015 Minimum Viable System scope defining 4 core files as MVS - This ena
- Created style-guide.
- Consolidated tasks from 107 to 21 - The original decomposition was over-engineer
- Technical Implementation Details

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: The spec kit had multiple quality issues: section numbering collision in spec.md, 77% content bloat in plan.md, weak decision records DR-009/DR-010, over-decomposed tasks (107 vs ~21 needed), missing L3+ artifacts (style-guide, examples); solution: Five parallel opus agents each handled one refinement task: (1) spec.md numbering + L3+ sections, (2) plan.md deduplication, (3) decision record strengthening, (4) task/checklist rationalization, (5) new style-guide + examples creation; patterns: Parallel agent orchestration pattern with 5 opus agents for independent file updates. Cross-reference pattern using Nigel de Lange spec folder as template for style-guide.md and examples.md creation.; anchors: {"summary-004":"Level 3+ refinement of Barter Deal Templates spec kit - 5 files updated, 2 new files created","decision-spec-refinement-004":"7 key decisions: section renumbering, plan deduplication, DR strengthening, task consolidation, MVS scope, new L3+ artifacts","files-004":"spec.md, plan.md, decision-record.md, tasks.md, checklist.md (updated); style-guide.md, examples.md (new)"}

### Message Timeline

> **User** | 2026-02-06 @ 10:46:42

Completed the Level 3+ refinement of the Barter Deal Templates spec kit (004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation). Five parallel opus agents updated 5 existing files and created 2 new files. spec.md was updated to v1.0.1 with fixed section numbering (collision at sections 3-5), added TOC, Executive Summary, NFRs, and Error Handling. plan.md was reduced by 70% (2,123 to 632 lines) by removing embedded KB content and replacing with reference tables, timeline recalibrated from 14 days to 8-10 hours, and 4 new L3+ sections added. decision-record.md had DR-009 and DR-010 strengthened (variations now description-only, DEPTH rounds now adaptive 7/10/5), 3 new DRs added (DR-011 Context Window, DR-014 Anti-AI Detection, DR-015 MVS Scope). tasks.md consolidated from 107 to 21 tasks with task-to-checklist cross-references. checklist.md populated with real completion counts. Two new L3+ artifacts created: style-guide.md (142 lines, 6 sections) and examples.md (192 lines, 3 annotated examples including anti-pattern).

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 002-barter/004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "002-barter/004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.js --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "002-barter/004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 002-barter/004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory/generate-context.js 002-barter/004-barter-deal-templates/001-initial-creation --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered
