## P0 — Hard Blockers
- [x] Zero "rounds" (as DEPTH rounds) in v0.200 — Verified: 0 occurrences
- [x] Zero "rounds" (as DEPTH rounds) in v0.500 — Verified: 0 occurrences (2 "question rounds" acceptable)
- [x] Zero "rounds" (as DEPTH rounds) in v0.900 — Verified: 0 occurrences
- [x] Zero "RICCE" in all three files — Verified: 0 occurrences each
- [x] Energy levels defined in DEPTH v0.200 — Verified: canonical table at lines 22-26
- [x] MEQT rubric canonical in System Prompt Section 6 — Verified: DEPTH v0.200 references it 4 times

## P1 — Must Complete
- [x] DEPTH v0.200 written (v0.114 → v0.200) — 246 lines, 34% reduction

- [x] System Prompt v0.900 written (v0.822 → v0.900) — 779 lines
- [x] Cross-file verification passed — all three files clean
- [x] Energy level terminology consistent (Quick/Standard/Deep) — verified across all files
- [x] Original files preserved alongside new versions — user can review and swap

## P2 — Can Defer
- [ ] AGENTS.md Sequential Thinking Protocol removal
- [ ] Token Budget file updates for new energy levels
- [ ] MEQT + HVR scoring unification
- [ ] Cognitive load reduction (200+ rules → ≤30)
