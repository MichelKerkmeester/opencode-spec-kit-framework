<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Embedding Cache (R18)

- [ ] T001 [P] Create `embedding_cache` table with migration — schema: `content_hash TEXT, model_id TEXT, embedding BLOB, dimensions INT, created_at TEXT, last_used_at TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (content_hash, model_id)` [8-12h] — R18 (REQ-S2-001)
  - [ ] T001a Create table migration with backup protocol — Implementation hint: Use `db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS embedding_cache ...')` pattern from existing migrations in `db.ts`
  - [ ] T001b Implement cache lookup logic in embedding pipeline — Implementation hint: Check `SELECT embedding FROM embedding_cache WHERE content_hash = ? AND model_id = ?` before calling embedding API; update `last_used_at` on hit
  - [ ] T001c Implement cache store logic on embedding generation — Implementation hint: After successful embedding generation, `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO embedding_cache ...`
  - [ ] T001d Add `last_used_at` update for cache eviction support — Enables future LRU eviction; `UPDATE embedding_cache SET last_used_at = datetime('now') WHERE content_hash = ? AND model_id = ?`
  - Acceptance: Cache hit rate >90% on re-index of unchanged content; cache lookup adds <1ms p95; model_id change triggers cache miss (correct behavior)

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Cold-Start Boost (N4)

- [ ] T002 [P] Implement cold-start boost with exponential decay behind `SPECKIT_NOVELTY_BOOST` flag (`composite-scoring.ts`) [3-5h] — N4 (REQ-S2-002)
  - Formula: `boost = 0.15 * exp(-elapsed_hours / 12)`
  - Applied BEFORE FSRS temporal decay
  - Combined score cap at 0.95
  - Acceptance: Boost at 0h = 0.15, at 12h = ~0.055, at 24h = ~0.020, at 48h = ~0.003 (effectively zero); dark-run passes
  - Implementation hint: In `composite-scoring.ts`, compute `elapsed_hours = (Date.now() - created_at_ms) / 3600000`; apply boost only when `process.env.SPECKIT_NOVELTY_BOOST === 'true'` and `elapsed_hours < 48`
  - Empirically verify: N4/FSRS interaction via dark-run (assertion alone insufficient — 0.95 cap creates interaction surface). Note: cap clipping is asymmetric — high-scoring memories (>0.80) receive less effective boost. This is expected behavior.

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: G2 Investigation

- [ ] T003 [P] Investigate double intent weighting — trace intent weight application through full pipeline (`hybrid-search.ts`) [4-6h] — G2 (REQ-S2-003)
  - [ ] T003a Identify all locations where intent weights are applied — Implementation hint: Search for `intent` weight application in 3 files: `hybrid-search.ts`, `intent-classifier.ts`, `adaptive-fusion.ts`. Trace the data flow from classification through to final scoring.
  - [ ] T003b Determine: bug or intentional design — Decision criteria: If weights are applied once in classification AND once in fusion, it is likely a bug (double-counting). If applied in classification for channel selection AND in fusion for score weighting (different purposes), it may be intentional.
  - [ ] T003c If bug: fix. If intentional: document rationale — Either way, dark-run comparison before/after to verify no MRR@5 regression
  - [ ] T003d Select normalization method — measure actual RRF and composite score distributions on 100-query sample; compare linear scaling vs. min-max output stability; document selection in decision record before Phase 4 begins [1-2h] {T003b} — OQ-S2-003 resolution
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-4 -->
## Phase 4: Score Normalization (depends on Phase 3)

- [ ] T004 Implement score normalization — both RRF and composite to [0,1] range (`rrf-fusion.ts`, `composite-scoring.ts`) [4-6h] {T003} — Calibration (REQ-S2-004)
  - Note: Normalization approach may depend on G2 outcome
- [ ] T004a [P] Investigate RRF K-value sensitivity — grid search K ∈ {20, 40, 60, 80, 100}, measure MRR@5 delta per value [2-3h] {T004} — Calibration (REQ-S2-005)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-4 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-5 -->
## Phase 5: Interference Scoring (TM-01)

- [ ] T005 [P] Implement interference scoring — add `interference_score` column to `memory_index` (migration), compute at index time by counting memories with cosine similarity > 0.75 in same `spec_folder`, apply as `-0.08 * interference_score` in `composite-scoring.ts` behind `SPECKIT_INTERFERENCE_SCORE` flag [4-6h] — TM-01 (REQ-S2-006)
  - Note: 0.75 similarity threshold and -0.08 penalty coefficient are initial calibration values, subject to tuning after 2 eval cycles. N4 boost is applied BEFORE TM-01 penalty in composite scoring pipeline (N4 establishes floor, TM-01 penalizes cluster density).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-5 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-6 -->
## Phase 6: Classification-Based Decay (TM-03)

- [ ] T006 [P] Implement classification-based decay in `fsrs-scheduler.ts` — decay policy multipliers by `context_type` (decisions: no decay, research: 2x stability, implementation/discovery/general: standard) and `importance_tier` (constitutional/critical: no decay, important: 1.5x, normal: standard, temporary: 0.5x) [3-5h] — TM-03 (REQ-S2-007)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-6 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-7 -->
## Phase 7: Verification

- [ ] T007 Verify dark-run results for N4, normalization, and TM-01 — new memories visible, old not displaced, MRR@5 not regressed, interference penalty correct [included] {T002, T004, T005}
- [ ] T008 [GATE] Sprint 2 exit gate verification [0h] {T001, T002, T003, T004, T004a, T005, T006, T007}
  - [ ] R18 cache hit >90% on unchanged content re-index
  - [ ] N4 dark-run passes
  - [ ] G2 resolved: fixed or documented as intentional
  - [ ] Score distributions normalized to [0,1]
  - [ ] RRF K-value investigation completed; optimal K documented
  - [ ] TM-01 interference penalty active; high-similarity cluster scores reduced; no false penalties
  - [ ] TM-03 classification-based decay verified — constitutional/critical memories not decaying; temporary memories decaying faster
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-7 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-8 -->
## Phase 8 (PI-A1): Folder-Level Relevance Scoring via DocScore Aggregation

- [ ] T009 [P] Implement folder-level relevance scoring in reranker — compute `FolderScore(F) = (1/sqrt(M+1)) * SUM(MemoryScore(m))` by grouping normalized memory scores by `spec_folder`; expose FolderScore as metadata on each search result; implement two-phase retrieval path (top-K folders by FolderScore then within-folder search) [4-8h] {T004} — PI-A1
  - Formula: `FolderScore = (1 / sqrt(M + 1)) * SUM(MemoryScore(m) for m in folder F)` where M = memory count in F
  - Damping factor `1/sqrt(M+1)` is mandatory — prevents large folders from dominating by volume
  - Pure scoring addition to existing reranker — no schema changes, no new tables
  - Requires [0,1]-normalized MemoryScore values from score normalization (T004) to be meaningful
  - Extends R-006 (weight rebalancing surface) and R-007 (post-reranker stage in scoring pipeline)
- [ ] T010 [P] Add lightweight observability — log N4 boost values and TM-01 interference scores at query time, sampled at 5% of queries [2-4h] {T002, T005} — Observability (P2)
