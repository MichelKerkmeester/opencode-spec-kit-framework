## What Was Built

Sprint 4 delivers five new capabilities that close the feedback loop in the Spec Kit Memory system. You can now aggregate chunk scores into document-level relevance (R1 MPAB), learn from user selections to improve future searches (R11), run shadow A/B comparisons without affecting production (R13-S2), block low-quality saves before they enter the index (TM-04), and automatically consolidate duplicate memories on save (TM-06). At Sprint 4 delivery time, all Sprint 4 flags were intentionally shipped as opt-in and OFF-by-default as a safety-first rollout exception.

### R1 MPAB Chunk-to-Memory Aggregation

Multi-Parent Aggregated Bonus computes document-level scores from individual chunk scores using the formula `sMax + 0.3 * sum(remaining) / sqrt(N)`. N=0 returns 0 (no signal), N=1 returns the raw score (no bonus). Chunk ordering preserves document position order, not score order. Gated by `SPECKIT_DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION`. Wired into the hybrid search pipeline after RRF fusion and before state filtering.

### R11 Learned Relevance Feedback

Learns from user memory selections through a separate `learned_triggers` column that is explicitly isolated from the FTS5 index. Ten strict safeguards prevent noise injection: separate column, 30-day TTL, 100+ stop word denylist, rate cap (3 per selection, 8 per memory), top-3 exclusion, 1-week shadow period, 72h memory age minimum, sprint gate review, rollback mechanism, and provenance audit log. Includes auto-promotion (5 validations promotes normal to important, 10 promotes important to critical) and negative feedback confidence signal (floor at 0.3). Runtime wiring is now active in both `memory_validate` (`mcp_server/handlers/checkpoints.ts`) and `memory_search` (`mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`). Gated by `SPECKIT_LEARN_FROM_SELECTION`.

### R13-S2 Shadow Scoring + Channel Attribution

Runs alternative scoring algorithms in parallel without affecting production results. Computes detailed comparison metrics including Kendall tau rank correlation, per-result score deltas, and production-only/shadow-only result sets. Channel attribution tags each result with its source channels and computes Exclusive Contribution Rate per channel. Ground truth expansion via implicit user selection tracking and LLM-judge stub interface. Gated by `SPECKIT_SHADOW_SCORING`.

### TM-04 Pre-Storage Quality Gate

Three-layer validation before storing memories. Layer 1 checks structural validity (title, content, spec folder). Layer 2 scores content quality across five dimensions (title, triggers, length, anchors, metadata) with a 0.4 signal density threshold. Layer 3 checks semantic dedup via cosine similarity, rejecting near-duplicates above 0.92. Includes MR12 warn-only mode for the first 14 days after activation. Gated by `SPECKIT_SAVE_QUALITY_GATE`.

### TM-06 Reconsolidation-on-Save

After embedding generation, checks the top-3 most similar memories in the same spec folder. Similarity at or above 0.88 triggers a merge (content combined, frequency counter incremented). Similarity between 0.75 and 0.88 triggers a conflict resolution (memory replaced, causal supersedes edge added). Below 0.75 stores the new memory unchanged. Gated by `SPECKIT_RECONSOLIDATION`.

## How It Was Delivered

All features shipped behind opt-in feature flags defaulting to OFF at Sprint 4 release. Five parallel opus agents implemented the independent modules simultaneously in worktree isolation, followed by a fifth integration agent that wired everything together. Each agent verified its own tests before completing. The integration agent confirmed all 315 tests pass together and TypeScript compiles with zero errors. Existing tests (handler-memory-save, rollout-policy, integration-save-pipeline) were re-verified at 173/173 and 27/27 passing.

The recommended S4a/S4b sub-sprint split is preserved: R1, R13-S2, TM-04, and TM-06 can be enabled immediately (S4a). R11 learned feedback requires the 28-day R13 eval cycle prerequisite before enabling (S4b). Transition from OFF-default to default-ON/permanent requires four criteria: sprint gate evidence passed, no open P0 regressions, NFR-O01 flag budget compliance (target <=6 active, hard ceiling <=8), and a documented sunset decision at the corresponding T-FS gate.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| All 5 features behind separate opt-in flags | Each feature can be independently tested and rolled back without affecting others |
| New modules as separate files (not inlined) | Keeps existing files stable, enables independent testing, clean separation of concerns |
| MPAB positioned after RRF fusion, before state filter | Aggregation must operate on fused scores, not pre-boosted channel scores |
| Shadow scoring as fire-and-forget with try/catch | Must never affect production search results under any circumstances |
| TM-04 warn-only mode for first 14 days | MR12 mitigation prevents over-filtering legitimate saves during threshold tuning |
| TM-04/TM-06 threshold gap [0.88, 0.92] intentional | Saves in this range pass quality gate (not near-duplicate) then get reconsolidated (similar enough to merge) |
| R11 FTS5 isolation verified by 5 CRITICAL tests | FTS5 contamination is irreversible without full re-index, so verification is defense-in-depth |
| Negative feedback floor at 0.3 | Prevents complete suppression of memories that received early negative feedback |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **R11 requires 28-day calendar window.** Learned feedback cannot be enabled until R13 completes 2 full eval cycles (minimum 100 queries AND 14+ calendar days each). Plan the project timeline explicitly.
2. **MPAB bonus coefficient is provisional.** The 0.3 coefficient must be validated against MRR@5 measurements from S4a shadow data before S4b begins. Exported as `MPAB_BONUS_COEFFICIENT` for easy tuning.
3. **R11 query weight is provisional.** The 0.7x weight for learned triggers should be derived from channel attribution data (R13-S2) during the idle window.
4. **TM-04 warn-only mode requires manual enablement after 14 days.** No automatic transition from warn-only to enforcement mode.
5. **G-NEW-3 Phase C LLM-judge is a stub.** The `generateLlmJudgeLabels()` function returns zero-valued labels as a type contract. Actual LLM integration is out of scope for Sprint 4.
6. **Startup migration/isolation is now conditional on R11 enablement.** `migrateLearnedTriggers(db)` and `verifyFts5Isolation(db)` now run at startup when `SPECKIT_LEARN_FROM_SELECTION=true`.

## Feature Flag Inventory (Sprint 4)

| Flag | Feature | Default | Sprint |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| `SPECKIT_DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION` | R1 MPAB chunk aggregation | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_SHADOW_SCORING` | R13-S2 shadow scoring | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_SAVE_QUALITY_GATE` | TM-04 pre-storage quality gate | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_RECONSOLIDATION` | TM-06 reconsolidation-on-save | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_LEARN_FROM_SELECTION` | R11 learned relevance feedback | OFF | S4b |
| `SPECKIT_NEGATIVE_FEEDBACK` | A4 negative feedback confidence demotion | OFF | S4b |

Sprint 4 OFF-default status is historical rollout posture, not a permanent policy. Each flag transitions only when the four criteria in "How It Was Delivered" are satisfied.
