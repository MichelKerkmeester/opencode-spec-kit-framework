## 2. Context Transfer

### 2.1 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| All 5 features behind separate opt-in flags (default OFF) | Independent testing, rollback, and staged enablement | `search-flags.ts`, `hybrid-search.ts`, `memory-save.ts` |
| New modules as separate files (not inlined into existing) | Clean separation, independent testing, minimal risk to existing code | 11 new source files in `lib/` |
| MPAB after RRF fusion, before state filter | Must aggregate on fused scores, not pre-boosted channel scores | `hybrid-search.ts` pipeline position |
| Shadow scoring as fire-and-forget with try/catch | Must never affect production search results | `hybrid-search.ts` end-of-pipeline |
| TM-04 warn-only mode for first 14 days (MR12) | Prevents over-filtering legitimate saves during threshold tuning | `save-quality-gate.ts` |
| TM-04/TM-06 threshold gap [0.88, 0.92] intentional | Saves pass quality gate then get reconsolidated (save-then-merge) | `save-quality-gate.ts`, `reconsolidation.ts` |
| R11 FTS5 isolation verified by 5 CRITICAL tests | FTS5 contamination is irreversible without full re-index | `learned-feedback.vitest.ts` |
| Negative feedback floor at 0.3 | Prevents complete suppression of early-negative memories | `negative-feedback.ts` |

### 2.2 Blockers Encountered

| Blocker | Status | Resolution/Workaround |
|---------|--------|----------------------|
| R11 28-day calendar prerequisite (R13 eval cycles) | OPEN — by design | R11 is scaffolded but cannot be enabled until 28+ days after Sprint 3 completion. S4a/S4b split preserves this. |
| No existing MPAB/shadow/learned-triggers code | RESOLVED | All built from scratch in new files |

### 2.3 Files Modified/Created

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `lib/scoring/mpab-aggregation.ts` | Created — R1 MPAB algorithm + chunk collapse | COMPLETE |
| `lib/eval/shadow-scoring.ts` | Created — R13-S2 shadow scoring engine | COMPLETE |
| `lib/eval/channel-attribution.ts` | Created — channel tagging + ECR metric | COMPLETE |
| `lib/eval/ground-truth-feedback.ts` | Created — G-NEW-3 Phase B/C | COMPLETE |
| `lib/validation/save-quality-gate.ts` | Created — TM-04 3-layer quality gate | COMPLETE |
| `lib/storage/reconsolidation.ts` | Created — TM-06 merge/conflict/complement | COMPLETE |
| `lib/search/learned-feedback.ts` | Created — R11 engine with 10 safeguards | COMPLETE |
| `lib/search/feedback-denylist.ts` | Created — 100+ stop word denylist | COMPLETE |
| `lib/storage/learned-triggers-schema.ts` | Created — schema migration + FTS5 isolation | COMPLETE |
| `lib/search/auto-promotion.ts` | Created — tier promotion (5/10 thresholds) | COMPLETE |
| `lib/scoring/negative-feedback.ts` | Created — confidence multiplier (floor 0.3) | COMPLETE |
| `lib/search/search-flags.ts` | Modified — 4 new Sprint 4 feature flags | COMPLETE |
| `lib/search/hybrid-search.ts` | Modified — MPAB + shadow scoring wiring | COMPLETE |
| `handlers/memory-save.ts` | Modified — quality gate + reconsolidation wiring | COMPLETE |
| `tests/mpab-aggregation.vitest.ts` | Created — 33 tests | COMPLETE |
| `tests/shadow-scoring.vitest.ts` | Created — 35 tests | COMPLETE |
| `tests/ground-truth-feedback.vitest.ts` | Created — 27 tests | COMPLETE |
| `tests/save-quality-gate.vitest.ts` | Created — 75 tests | COMPLETE |
| `tests/reconsolidation.vitest.ts` | Created — 45 tests | COMPLETE |

## 3. For Next Session

### 3.1 Recommended Starting Point

- **File**: `005-sprint-4-feedback-and-quality/checklist.md`
- **Context**: Mark all checklist items with evidence. Many P0 and P1 items can now be verified against the test results and implementation.

### 3.2 Priority Tasks Remaining

1. **Update checklist.md** — Mark verified items `[x]` with evidence from test results (315 tests passing)
2. **Update tasks.md** — Mark completed tasks `[x]` (T001, T001a, T002, T002a, T002b, T003, T003a, T007, T008, T027a, T027b)
3. **Commit changes** — Stage and commit all Sprint 4 implementation files
4. **Begin Sprint 5** — `/spec_kit:implement .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/006-sprint-5-pipeline-refactor/`
5. **S4b timeline planning** — When R13 completes 2+ eval cycles (28+ days), enable R11 learned feedback

### 3.3 Critical Context to Load

- [ ] Memory file: `memory/28-02-26_09-06__sprint-4-feedback-and-quality.md`
- [ ] Spec file: `spec.md` (all sections — requirements REQ-S4-001 through REQ-S4-005)
- [ ] Plan file: `plan.md` (Phase 1-6 implementation phases)
- [ ] Implementation summary: `implementation-summary.md`

---

## 4. Validation Checklist

Before handover, verify:
- [x] All in-progress work completed (all 5 agents finished)
- [x] Memory file saved with current context (memory #2040)
- [x] No breaking changes left mid-implementation
- [x] Tests passing — 315/315 Sprint 4 tests, 0 TypeScript errors
- [x] Existing tests still passing — 173/173 + 27/27 (no regression)
- [x] Implementation summary created
- [x] POSTFLIGHT captured (LI: 22, moderate learning)
- [x] This handover document is complete

## 5. Session Notes

### Feature Flag Inventory at Sprint 4 Exit

| Flag | Feature | Default | Sub-Sprint |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| `SPECKIT_DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION` | R1 MPAB | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_SHADOW_SCORING` | R13-S2 Shadow | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_SAVE_QUALITY_GATE` | TM-04 Quality Gate | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_RECONSOLIDATION` | TM-06 Reconsolidation | OFF | S4a |
| `SPECKIT_LEARN_FROM_SELECTION` | R11 Learned Feedback | OFF | S4b |

### Provisional Values Needing Validation

- **MPAB bonus coefficient**: 0.3 — validate against MRR@5 from S4a shadow data
- **R11 query weight**: 0.7x — derive from R13-S2 channel attribution data during F10 idle window
- **TM-04 signal density threshold**: 0.4 — tune during warn-only period based on false-rejection rate

### Learning Index

- Preflight: K:65, U:30, C:75
- Postflight: K:90, U:10, C:95
- Learning Index: **22** (Moderate — all 4 original knowledge gaps closed, 3 new gaps discovered)
