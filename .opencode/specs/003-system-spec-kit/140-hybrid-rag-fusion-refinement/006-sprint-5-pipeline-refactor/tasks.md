## Phase A: R6 Pipeline Refactor

- [ ] T001 Create checkpoint: `memory_checkpoint_create("pre-pipeline-refactor")` [0h]
- [ ] T002 Implement 4-stage pipeline refactor — Stage 1 (Candidate Gen), Stage 2 (Fusion + Signal Integration), Stage 3 (Rerank + Aggregate), Stage 4 (Filter + Annotate — NO score changes), behind `SPECKIT_PIPELINE_V2` flag [40-55h] {T001} — R6

> **F9 — REQUIRED: Decompose T002 (R6) into 5-8 subtasks** (R6 is a 40-55h single task; decomposition reduces integration risk and enables incremental verification):
>
> - **T002a** [5-8h]: Stage architecture definition — define TypeScript interfaces for each stage's input/output types; enforce Stage 4 immutability via TypeScript read-only type guards (compile-time) with runtime assertion as defense-in-depth (OQ-S5-001 CLOSED)
> - **T002b** [6-9h]: Stage 1 implementation — Candidate generation; migrate 5-channel parallel execution into Stage 1 boundary; preserve existing channel behavior exactly
> - **T002c** [8-12h]: Stage 2 implementation — Fusion + Signal Integration; consolidate all scoring signals (RRF/RSF, causal boost, co-activation, composite, intent weights) into single application point; verify G2 cannot recur
> - **T002d** [6-9h]: Stage 3 implementation — Rerank + Aggregate; migrate cross-encoder, MMR, MPAB into Stage 3; MPAB must remain after RRF (preserve Sprint 4 pipeline position)
> - **T002e** [5-8h]: Stage 4 implementation — Filter + Annotate; migrate state filter, session dedup, constitutional injection, channel attribution; add Stage 4 invariant guard (assert no score mutation)
> - **T002f** [5-8h]: Integration + backward compatibility; wire all 4 stages behind `SPECKIT_PIPELINE_V2` flag; old pipeline remains when flag is OFF
> - **T002g** [3-5h]: Feature flag interaction testing — verify all 10+ accumulated flags (Sprint 0-5) work correctly under PIPELINE_V2; flags: SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER, RSF_FUSION, CHANNEL_MIN_REP, DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION, LEARN_FROM_SELECTION, SAVE_QUALITY_GATE, RECONSOLIDATION, PIPELINE_V2, EMBEDDING_EXPANSION + any from prior sprints
>   **Flag interaction matrix (UT-7 R5)**: Flags that interact with PIPELINE_V2 (scoring/pipeline flags): RSF_FUSION, CHANNEL_MIN_REP, DOCSCORE_AGGREGATION, LEARN_FROM_SELECTION. Flags independent of PIPELINE_V2 (context/session flags): SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER, SAVE_QUALITY_GATE, RECONSOLIDATION, EMBEDDING_EXPANSION. Test strategy: pairwise coverage of the 4 interacting flags (6 pairs × 2 states = 12 test configurations) + 1 all-flags-on run. Document coverage matrix as CHK-075 evidence.
> - **T002h** [2-4h]: Dark-run verification — 0 ordering differences vs full eval corpus; this gate MUST pass before Phase B begins

- [ ] T003 Verify R6 dark-run: 0 ordering differences on full eval corpus [included] {T002}
- [ ] T004 Verify all 158+ tests pass with `SPECKIT_PIPELINE_V2` enabled [included] {T002}
- [ ] T004b Record p95 simple query latency baseline on eval corpus before R12 implementation [1-2h] {T004} — R12 baseline (UT-7 R3)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-a -->

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-b -->
## Phase B: Search + Spec-Kit (after Phase A passes)

- [ ] T005 [P] Implement spec folder pre-filter [5-8h] {T004} — R9
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement query expansion with R15 mutual exclusion, behind `SPECKIT_EMBEDDING_EXPANSION` flag [10-15h] {T004} — R12
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement template anchor optimization [5-8h] {T004} — S2
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement validation signals as retrieval metadata [4-6h] {T004} — S3
- [ ] T009a [P] Add memory auto-surface hooks at tool dispatch and session compaction lifecycle points in `hooks/auto-surface.ts` — per-point token budget 4000 max; config/logic change in Spec-Kit integration layer [4-6h] {T004} — TM-05 (REQ-S5-006)
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-b -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pageindex -->
## PageIndex Tasks

- [ ] T011 Implement PI-B1 tree thinning for spec folder consolidation — extend generate-context.js with bottom-up merge logic: files < 200 tokens merge summary into parent, files < 500 tokens use content as summary; memory thresholds: 300 tokens (thinning), 100 tokens (text is summary); operates pre-pipeline before Stage 1 candidate generation [10-14h] — PI-B1
  - Thinning runs in context loading step (before pipeline, does not affect stage boundaries)
  - Verify no content loss during merge — parent absorbs child summary faithfully
  - Verify R9 pre-filter interaction: thinning does not alter folder identity or pre-filter behavior
- [ ] T012 Implement PI-B2 progressive validation for spec documents — extend validate.sh to 4-level pipeline: Detect (identify violations) → Auto-fix (missing dates, heading levels, whitespace normalization, with before/after diff log) → Suggest (guided options for non-automatable issues) → Report (structured output, exit 0/1/2 compatible); include dry-run mode [16-24h] — PI-B2
  - All auto-fixes must log before/after diff (primary mitigation for silent corruption)
  - Dry-run mode: show proposed auto-fixes without applying them
  - Exit code compatibility: exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = warnings, exit 2 = errors (unchanged)
