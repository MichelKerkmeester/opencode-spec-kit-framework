# Implementation Summary — Sprint 0: Measurement Foundation

## Overview

Sprint 0 delivered the measurement foundation for the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement program. It fixed two P0 bugs (graph channel ID format mismatch producing 0% hit rate, and chunk collapse skipping dedup on `includeContent=false` paths), built a complete evaluation infrastructure with a separate `speckit-eval.db` database (5-table schema), implemented 9 metric functions (4 core + 5 diagnostic), generated 110 ground truth queries with diversity validation, and scaffolded the BM25 baseline runner with a 3-band contingency evaluator. Infrastructure is complete; 3 exit gates remain PARTIAL pending live-DB execution.

## Key Changes

## Test Coverage

- New tests: 268 (across 11 test files)
- All tests passing: Yes (4876 total, 164 test files)
- Key test files: `t004-eval-db.vitest.ts` (27 tests), `t006-eval-metrics.vitest.ts` (~30 tests), `t007-ground-truth.vitest.ts` (12 tests), `t008-bm25-baseline.vitest.ts` (12 tests), `t013-eval-the-eval.vitest.ts` (hand-calc validation)

## Decisions Made

1. **Separate eval database (`speckit-eval.db`)** -- Isolation ensures eval load cannot degrade primary DB; eval logging gated by `SPECKIT_EVAL_LOGGING` env var.
2. **SHA256 fast-path dedup scoped to same `spec_folder`** -- Prevents false positives across projects while providing O(1) exact-duplicate rejection.
3. **Fan-effect divisor formula: `1/sqrt(neighbor_count)`** -- Reduces hub-memory domination in co-activation results by ~55%; bounds-checked with zero-division guard.
4. **Ground truth placeholder IDs (`memoryId=-1`)** -- Real ID mapping deferred to live-DB execution phase; all relevance judgments use -1 until resolved.
5. **Parallel wave execution (3 sonnet agents/wave)** -- Non-overlapping file sets allowed safe parallel delivery of 35 files across 4 commit waves.

## Known Limitations

- 3 exit gates remain PARTIAL pending live-DB execution (gates 3, 5, 6 in T009)
- Ground truth memory IDs are placeholders (`-1`); must be mapped against production DB before baseline metrics are meaningful
- `relevanceWeight=0.2` anomaly in `search-weights.json` is flagged but unresolved; may skew BM25 comparison results
- T004b observer-effect mitigation not yet implemented (deferred to Sprint 1)
- B8 signal ceiling at 12/12; Sprint 1 must retire a signal before adding a new one
