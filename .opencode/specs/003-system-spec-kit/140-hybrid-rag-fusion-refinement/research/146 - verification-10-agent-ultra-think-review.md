# 146 — Verification: 10-Agent Ultra-Think Review of Spec 140

> **Independent re-verification of all findings from the 10-Agent Ultra-Think Review (composite score 73/100) using ultra-think deep analysis, sequential thinking, and cross-document evidence gathering.** Confirms 80% accuracy, identifies 3 material errors in the review's corrective recommendations, and discovers 5 new issues.

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Method:** Ultra-think agent with sequential thinking + parallel exploration of all 8 child sprint folders + cross-reference against spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, and research/143-145.
**Scope:** All 6 cross-agent convergent issues, corrections between waves, Sprint 0 CONDITIONAL-GO blockers, and all 14 priority amendments.

---

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Review findings verified** | 6/6 (all real issues; severity varies) |
| **Findings fully confirmed** | 3/6 (Findings 2, 3, 4) |
| **Findings partially confirmed** | 3/6 (Findings 1, 5, 6 — real issues but with errors in characterization) |
| **Material errors in review** | 3 (P0-1 direction backwards, NFR-P01 "<=5ms" fabricated, ADOPT items framed as "missing" when tracked) |
| **New issues discovered** | 5 |
| **Priority amendments valid** | 12/14 |
| **Priority amendments incorrect** | 2/14 (P0-1 direction, P0-5 sub-items 2 and 5) |
| **Composite score (73/100)** | **Defensible** — agrees with independent assessment |
| **Review overall accuracy** | ~80% |

### Bottom Line

The 10-Agent Ultra-Think Review correctly identifies the major cross-document inconsistencies in Spec 140 and provides mostly actionable amendments. Its primary errors are: (1) the corrective direction for effort numbers is backwards — plan.md should be updated **upward** to match tasks.md, not spec.md downward; (2) the NFR-P01 "<=5ms" claim used in Sprint 0 Blocker #2 is fabricated; and (3) Finding 5 overstates severity by not acknowledging that all ADOPT items ARE tracked in tasks and checklists despite lacking formal REQ-### IDs.

The spec folder remains architecturally sound. All issues are correctable without architectural changes. With the corrected P0 amendments (~6-8h of spec work), the program is ready for Sprint 0 execution.

## 1. Methodology

### Verification Approach

1. **Ultra-think agent** — Re-examined all 6 findings against the actual spec documents using multi-strategy analysis with sequential thinking
2. **Parallel exploration** — Read all 8 child sprint folder files to verify claims about missing checkpoints, stale dependencies, and effort discrepancies
3. **Independent arithmetic** — Independently summed all task effort estimates from tasks.md to verify claimed totals
4. **Cross-document alignment** — Compared every claim against its cited source location

### Evidence Standard

Each finding classified as:
- **CONFIRMED** — Evidence fully supports the claim as stated
- **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED** — Underlying issue is real but characterization contains errors
- **OVERSTATED** — Issue exists but severity/impact is exaggerated
- **INCORRECT** — Claim is factually wrong

---

## 2. Verification of 6 Convergent Issues

### Finding 1: Effort Arithmetic Errors

**Verdict: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED — discrepancies are real but the review's corrective recommendation is backwards**

#### Evidence Table

| Source | S0-S6 | S0-S7 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| spec.md (executive summary, line 22) | 314-467h | 355-524h |
| plan.md (summary, line 33) | 270-395h | 313-456h |
| plan.md (effort table, lines 390-391) | 268-394h | 313-456h |
| tasks.md (header, line 3) | 314-467h | 355-524h |
| **Independent task sum** | **316-472h** | **361-534h** |

#### Sprint-Level Verification

| Sprint | plan.md Header | Actual Task Sum | Delta | Review Claim |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| S0 | 30-45h | 45-70h | +50% | CONFIRMED |
| S1 | 22-31h | 24-35h | +9% | Not flagged (minor) |
| S2 | 19-29h | 21-32h | +10% | Not flagged (minor) |
| S3 | 26-40h | 34-53h | +31% | Not flagged |
| S4 | 39-56h | 60-89h | +54% | CONFIRMED |
| S5 | 64-92h | 64-92h | 0% | — |
| S6 | 68-101h | 68-101h | 0% | — |
| S7 | 45-62h | 45-62h | 0% | — |

#### Critical Correction

The review recommends **P0-1: "Fix executive summary hours: 314-467h → 268-394h (S0-S6)"**. This is **backwards**.

- spec.md's 314-467h is close to actual task sums (316-472h) — it's the most accurate number
- plan.md's 268-394h is the stale pre-research-145 total that was never updated after 20-34h of new tasks were added
- **Correct fix:** Update plan.md effort table and summary **upward** to match tasks.md actuals, not spec.md downward

#### Additional Discovery

plan.md summary says "270-395h" but its effort table totals 268-394h — a minor 2h/1h rounding gap.

---

### Finding 2: R6 Pipeline Refactor Contradiction

**Verdict: CONFIRMED**

#### Evidence

| Document | Location | R6 Characterization |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| plan.md ADR-001 (line 525) | Architecture Decision Record | "R6 pipeline refactor becomes **optional optimization**, not prerequisite" |
| plan.md Critical Path (line 485) | Critical Path section | Listed as **CRITICAL** item #5, 40-55h |
| spec.md REQ-018 (line 176) | Requirements | **P2** (Desired) |
| checklist.md CHK-S51 (line 155) | Sprint 5 gate | **P1** (Required) — intentionally elevated per line 271 |
| plan.md Sprint 5 (line 221) | Sprint schedule | **Unconditionally** scheduled, 40-55h |

The contradiction exists **within plan.md itself**: ADR-001 calls R6 "optional optimization" while Critical Path lists it as CRITICAL. No Sprint 2 calibration-failure gate condition explicitly triggers R6. A developer reading these documents would not have a clear answer on whether to plan 40-55h for Sprint 5.

**Resolution recommendation:** Either (a) remove R6 from Critical Path and add a Sprint 2 calibration-failure gate that conditionally activates it, or (b) update ADR-001 to say R6 is "deferred, not optional" and document the trigger condition.

---

### Finding 3: Missing Checkpoint Tasks

**Verdict: CONFIRMED — the cleanest, most clearly substantiated finding**

#### Evidence (Cross-referenced across parent + child folders)

| Sprint | plan.md Requirement | Parent tasks.md | Child tasks.md | Rollback Risk |
|--------|--------------------|----|---|---|
| Sprint 4 | YES (lines 333, 405) | **MISSING** | **MISSING** — no mention of checkpoint | MEDIUM-HIGH (FTS5 contamination) |
| Sprint 5 | YES (lines 333, 405) | T032 (line 142) | T001 (line 38) — explicit `memory_checkpoint_create("pre-pipeline-refactor")` | HIGH |
| Sprint 6 | YES (lines 333, 405) | **MISSING** | **INCOMPLETE** — mentioned in Completion Criteria (line 86) but no actionable task | HIGH (irreversible graph mutations) |

Checklist CHK-122 (line 210) also requires checkpoints before all three sprints. Sprint 6's child folder acknowledges the need in completion criteria ("Checkpoint created before sprint start") but has no task to execute it — an orphaned criterion.

**Impact:** Sprint 4 (R11 learned triggers with FTS5 contamination risk) and Sprint 6 (N3-lite irreversible graph mutations) carry CRITICAL/HIGH rollback risk without pre-sprint checkpoints. This is a safety gap.

---

### Finding 4: Vague Acceptance Criteria

**Verdict: CONFIRMED**

The review claims ~10 of 31 REQs have vague acceptance criteria. Independent analysis finds **12** with varying degrees of vagueness:

| REQ | Criteria Text | Issue |
|-----|----------|-------|
| REQ-006 | "Hub domination reduced" | No metric, no threshold |
| REQ-008 | "surface when relevant without displacing" | No definition of "displacing" |
| REQ-015 | "Full A/B comparison infrastructure operational" | "Operational" undefined |
| REQ-016 | "initial pattern report" | No format or quality bar |
| REQ-020 | "No degradation of simple query latency" | No threshold for "degradation" |
| REQ-021 | "Anchor-aware retrieval metadata available" | Binary but no quality measure |
| REQ-022 | "Validation metadata integrated in scoring" | Vague integration criteria |
| REQ-024 | "Intent metadata captured at index time" | Binary but no quality measure |
| REQ-027 | "at least 1 known contradiction" | Trivially passable for 10-15h of work |
| REQ-028 | "Hierarchy traversal functional" | No performance or accuracy criteria |
| REQ-029 | "Summary pre-filtering reduces search space" | No percentage or threshold |
| REQ-030 | "Content generation quality improved" | Entirely subjective |

The review's specific examples (REQ-006, REQ-016, REQ-027, REQ-030) are all correctly identified.

**Minor correction:** The review characterizes REQ-031 as "entirely subjective." It is actually shallow/binary ("Entity links established") rather than subjective. REQ-030 is the truly subjective one.

---

### Finding 5: Missing Research ADOPT Items

**Verdict: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED — correctly identifies a traceability gap but overstates practical severity**

#### Evidence

The review claims "5 of 7 ADOPT items have no REQ entry." In fact, **all 7 of 7** ADOPT items lack formal REQ-### entries. However, all 7 ARE integrated into the spec system through tasks and checklists:

| ADOPT Item | Has REQ-###? | Has Task? | Has Checklist Item? | Has Spec Mention? |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| A2 (Full-context ceiling) | No | T006 (included) | CHK-S07 | Yes (Section 8, Edge Cases) |
| A7 (Co-activation boost) | No | T010a | CHK-S15 | No |
| A4 (Negative feedback) | No | T027d | CHK-S47 | No |
| B2 (Chunk ordering) | No | T026a | CHK-S48 | No |
| B7 (Quality proxy) | No | T006 (included) | CHK-S08 | No |
| B8 (Signal ceiling) | No | T000b (partial) | CHK-S0A | Yes (Section 13, Compliance) |
| D4 (Observer effect) | No | T004b | CHK-S09 | Yes (NFR-D03 relates) |

The gap is one of **formal traceability** (no REQ-### IDs, making requirement-to-implementation tracking harder) rather than **coverage** (all items have tasks and checklist verification). The review's impact descriptions (e.g., "Sprint 1 work partially wasted" for A7) are accurate in isolation but the framing as "missing" overstates severity — they're tracked, just not formally numbered.

**Recommendation:** Add REQ-032 through REQ-038 for all 7 items. Low effort (~1h), high traceability value.

---

### Finding 6: Eval Infrastructure Fragility

**Verdict: PARTIALLY CONFIRMED — 2 sub-claims valid, 1 overstated, 1 incorrect**

| Sub-Claim | Verdict | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| No backup requirement for speckit-eval.db | **PARTIALLY CONFIRMED** | Generic backup-before-migration rule exists (plan.md rule 1), but no ongoing backup requirement for accumulated eval data. Plan treats eval DB as disposable (rollback S0 = "Delete file"). Eval data is the epistemological foundation per ADR-004 — losing accumulated ground truth post-Sprint 0 would be costly. |
| R13 telemetry pipeline undefined | **OVERSTATED** | Mechanism IS defined: T005 specifies logging hooks in `memory_search`, `memory_context`, `memory_match_triggers` handlers. "Underspecified" would be accurate; "undefined" is wrong. |
| Observer effect risk | **OVERSTATED** | Spec explicitly addresses this: NFR-D03 (separate DB), T004b (p95 health check), CHK-S09 (<=10% threshold). The review overlooks these existing mitigations. |
| "2 eval cycles" temporally undefined | **CONFIRMED** | No document defines what constitutes an "eval cycle" — query count? calendar time? synthetic fallback threshold? This is a genuine ambiguity that could block Sprint 4. |

#### Material Error in the Review

The review's Sprint 0 Blocker #2 claims: "Reconcile D4 observer-effect threshold (**NFR-P01 says <=5ms** vs T004b says <=10%)."

**This is incorrect.** NFR-P01 (spec.md line 258) says "Search response MUST NOT exceed **500ms** p95." It does NOT say <=5ms. The "<=5ms" figure appears nowhere in any document. There is no contradiction to reconcile.

---

## 3. Verification of Corrections Between Waves

**Both corrections are VALID.**

| Correction | Verdict | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| SC-002 and SC-003 ARE covered by CHK-S65 | **CONFIRMED** | CHK-S65 (checklist.md line 169): "All health dashboard targets met (MRR@5 +10-15%, **graph hit >20%**, **channel diversity >3.0**)" — directly maps to SC-002 and SC-003. |
| Feature flag sunset IS addressed by CHK-124 and CHK-S75 | **CONFIRMED** | CHK-124 (line 212): 90-day lifecycle + monthly audit. CHK-S75 (line 178): final sunset audit. The remaining observation about a missing per-sprint sunset schedule is valid but minor. |

---

## 4. Verification of Sprint 0 CONDITIONAL-GO Blockers

| # | Blocker | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Document logging hook injection locations for T005 | **PARTIALLY VALID** | Handler names ARE specified (3 handlers). Exact `file:function` injection points are unspecified but reasonably discoverable. Acceptable vagueness at spec level. |
| 2 | Reconcile D4 threshold (NFR-P01 <=5ms vs T004b <=10%) | **INCORRECT** | NFR-P01 says 500ms, NOT <=5ms. Fabricated contradiction. No reconciliation needed. |
| 3 | Define A2 LLM ceiling mechanism | **PARTIALLY VALID** | Conceptually described in spec.md Edge Cases and research/145. API/prompt/parsing details unspecified. Acceptable for a 4-6h exploratory task at spec level. |
| 4 | Specify BM25 channel isolation approach | **VALID** | No specification of how to isolate BM25 for baseline testing exists. T008 says "Run BM25-only baseline measurement" but doesn't define isolation method. |
| 5 | Correct G3 line-number discrepancy (plan.md ~303 vs checklist.md ~1002) | **UNVERIFIABLE** | No conflicting G3 line numbers found in any document. May reference an earlier version or be a phantom issue. |

**Corrected CONDITIONAL-GO:** 3 of 5 blockers are valid (1 partially, 3 and 4 fully). Blockers 2 and 5 should be removed. This reduces spec amendment work from ~4-5h to ~2-3h.

---

## 5. Verification of Priority Amendments

### P0 — Must Fix

| # | Amendment | Verdict | Notes |
|---|-----------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Fix executive summary hours downward | **INCORRECT DIRECTION** | spec.md 314-467h ≈ actual task sums 316-472h. plan.md 268-394h should be updated **upward**. See Finding 1. |
| 2 | Resolve R6 contradiction | **VALID** | ADR-001 "optional" vs Critical Path "CRITICAL" is a genuine contradiction. |
| 3 | Add checkpoint tasks for Sprint 4 and 6 | **VALID** | Both parent and child tasks.md lack checkpoint tasks. Sprint 6 has orphaned completion criterion. |
| 4 | Update plan.md Sprint 0 and Sprint 4 effort | **VALID** | S0: 30-45h → 45-70h. S4: 39-56h → 60-89h. Also S3: 26-40h → 34-53h (not flagged by review). |
| 5 | Resolve 5 Sprint 0 blockers | **3/5 VALID** | Blockers 1, 3, 4 valid. Blocker 2 incorrect (fabricated NFR-P01 figure). Blocker 5 unverifiable. |

### P1 — Should Fix

| # | Amendment | Verdict | Notes |
|---|-----------|---------|-------|
| 6 | Add REQ entries for ADOPT items | **VALID (understated)** | Should be all 7 items, not just 5. |
| 7 | Quantify 10 vague acceptance criteria | **VALID** | Actually 12 vague criteria identified. |
| 8 | Define "eval cycle" explicitly | **VALID** | Temporal ambiguity could block Sprint 4. |
| 9 | Add eval DB backup requirement | **VALID** | Accumulated eval data is ADR-004's epistemological foundation. |
| 10 | Add flag sunset schedule | **VALID** | Per-sprint sunset targets missing despite CHK-124 governance. |

### P2 — Should Fix

| # | Amendment | Verdict | Notes |
|---|-----------|---------|-------|
| 11 | Add cross-reference index | **VALID** | Would significantly improve navigability. |
| 12 | Fix Sprint 3 stale dependency references | **CONFIRMED by child folder exploration** | Sprint 3 spec.md (line 46-47) claims R3, R7, R8 as Sprint 2 dependencies. Parent spec does NOT list these in Sprint 2 scope. |
| 13 | Correct S6 checklist priority demotions | **VALID** | Safety-critical NFRs at P2 is inconsistent with risk level. |
| 14 | Add design principles section | **VALID** | The three principles (Evaluation First, Density Before Deepening, Calibration Before Surgery) are scattered across documents. |

---

## 6. New Issues Discovered During Verification

### Issue V1: plan.md Summary vs Table Inconsistency

plan.md summary (line 33) says "**270-395h** for S0-S6" but the effort table (line 390) totals **268-394h**. Minor 2h/1h rounding gap, but all numbers should be consistent.

### Issue V2: Origin of 314-467h Unknown

The spec.md and tasks.md figure of 314-467h does not match the pre-145 plan total (268-394h) or the post-145 research total (355-524h). It appears to be from an intermediate calculation state. Actual task sums are 316-472h (S0-S6), making 314-467h close but not exact.

### Issue V3: Sprint 6 Orphaned Completion Criterion

The child folder `007-sprint-6-graph-deepening/tasks.md` (line 86) states "Checkpoint created before sprint start" in Completion Criteria but has no corresponding task to create the checkpoint. This is an orphaned criterion — it will fail verification with no clear owner.

### Issue V4: Sprint 1 Effort Also Underestimated

plan.md says 22-31h for Sprint 1, but actual task sum (with A7 addition T010a) is 24-35h. Not flagged by the review. Same pattern affects Sprint 3 (26-40h header vs 34-53h actual).

### Issue V5: Sprint 3 Child Spec Has Stale Dependencies

Sprint 3 spec.md (004-sprint-3-query-intelligence/spec.md, lines 46-47) states:
> **Dependencies**: Sprint 2 exit gate (scoring calibration complete — **R3, R7, R8**, N4 verified)

However, parent spec.md (line 112) lists Sprint 2 scope as only **R18, N4, G2, score normalization**. R3 is explicitly SKIPPED (out of scope, spec.md line 78). R7 is Sprint 6 (REQ-023). R8 is Sprint 7 (REQ-029). These are ghost dependencies from an earlier version of the plan.

## 7. Corrected Priority Amendments

Based on verification, here is the corrected and prioritized amendment list:

### P0 — Must Fix (Blocks Execution)

| # | Amendment | Effort | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| P0-1 | **Update plan.md effort table upward** to match task sums: S0=45-70h, S1=24-35h, S3=34-53h, S4=60-89h. Update S0-S6 total to ~316-472h, S0-S7 total to ~361-534h. Reconcile spec.md if needed. | 1-2h | Finding 1 (corrected direction) |
| P0-2 | **Resolve R6 contradiction** in plan.md: either remove from Critical Path and add Sprint 2 calibration-failure gate, or update ADR-001 to say "deferred, not optional" | 1h | Finding 2 |
| P0-3 | **Add checkpoint tasks for Sprint 4 and Sprint 6** in both parent tasks.md and child folder tasks.md. Sprint 4: before R11 mutations. Sprint 6: before N3-lite graph mutations. | 1h | Finding 3 |
| P0-4 | **Specify BM25 channel isolation approach** for T008 baseline measurement | 0.5h | Sprint 0 Blocker #4 |
| P0-5 | **Fix Sprint 3 child spec stale dependencies** — remove R3, R7, R8 references from Sprint 3 spec.md dependency list | 0.5h | Issue V5 |
| | **P0 Total** | **~4-5h** | |

### P1 — Should Fix (Prevents Gate Ambiguity)

| # | Amendment | Effort | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| P1-1 | **Add REQ-032 through REQ-038** for all 7 ADOPT items (A2, A7, A4, B2, B7, B8, D4) | 1h | Finding 5 |
| P1-2 | **Quantify 12 vague acceptance criteria** — add measurable thresholds to REQ-006, REQ-008, REQ-015, REQ-016, REQ-020, REQ-021, REQ-022, REQ-024, REQ-027, REQ-028, REQ-029, REQ-030 | 2-3h | Finding 4 |
| P1-3 | **Define "eval cycle" explicitly**: e.g., "minimum 100 logged queries spanning at least 7 calendar days, OR 50 queries with synthetic ground truth" | 0.5h | Finding 6 |
| P1-4 | **Add eval DB backup requirement** to migration safety protocol and Sprint 0 tasks | 0.5h | Finding 6 |
| P1-5 | **Add per-sprint flag sunset schedule** documenting which flags resolve at which sprint boundary | 1h | Review P1-10 |
| P1-6 | **Fix Sprint 6 orphaned checkpoint criterion** — convert completion criteria line to actionable task | 0.5h | Issue V3 |
| | **P1 Total** | **~5.5-6.5h** | |

### P2 — Should Fix (Improves Quality)

| # | Amendment | Effort | Source |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|
| P2-1 | **Add cross-reference index** (Recommendation Code → REQ-ID → Sprint → Task → Risk → DEF-ID) | 2-3h | Review P2-11 |
| P2-2 | **Correct S6 checklist priority demotions** — elevate safety-critical NFRs from P2 to P1 | 0.5h | Review P2-13 |
| P2-3 | **Add "Three Non-Negotiable Design Principles" section** to spec.md for developer orientation | 1h | Review P2-14 |
| P2-4 | **Reconcile plan.md summary vs table** — fix "270-395h" to match table total | 0.5h | Issue V1 |
| | **P2 Total** | **~4-5h** | |

**Total amendment effort: ~13.5-16.5h** (P0: 4-5h mandatory, P1: 5.5-6.5h recommended, P2: 4-5h optional)

---

## 8. Strengths Confirmed

The review correctly identifies these as genuine strengths of the spec folder:

| # | Strength | Verification |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Evaluation-first epistemology (ADR-004)** — Making R13 a Sprint 0 P0 blocker is the single best architectural decision | CONFIRMED — prevents speculative optimization |
| 2 | **Metric-gated sprints (ADR-002)** — Converting uncertainty into 8 go/no-go decision points | CONFIRMED — powerful systemic risk control |
| 3 | **BM25 contingency matrix** — Three-path decision with 2x2 full-context ceiling interpretation | CONFIRMED — sophisticated planning |
| 4 | **MR1-MR7 risk identification** — Genuinely strong self-correction from prior analyses | CONFIRMED — covers FTS5 contamination, preferential attachment, flag explosion, div-by-zero |
| 5 | **Full requirement traceability** — All 31 REQs map to tasks; all sprint gates are measurable | CONFIRMED (with caveat: 7 ADOPT items lack REQ IDs) |
| 6 | **FTS5 contamination prevention (ADR-005)** — Separate `learned_triggers` column is technically airtight | CONFIRMED — prevents irreversible data corruption |
| 7 | **Sprint 0-1 child folders** — Score 83-85/100, well-specified and ready for execution | CONFIRMED via child folder inspection |
| 8 | **Off-ramp at Sprint 2+3** — Correctly positioned with quantitative thresholds | CONFIRMED — MRR@5 >= 0.7, constitutional >= 95%, cold-start >= 90% |

---

## 9. Final Accuracy Assessment

### Review Accuracy Scorecard

| Aspect | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Finding identification** | 5/6 real issues, 0 phantom issues | All 6 are real; severity calibration varies |
| **Evidence quality** | Strong for 1-4, weaker for 5-6 | Finding 6 contains 1 fabricated data point |
| **Severity calibration** | Generally accurate | Finding 5 slightly overstated, Finding 6 mixed |
| **Corrective recommendations** | 12/14 valid | P0-1 backwards, P0-5.2 fabricated |
| **Corrections between waves** | 2/2 valid | Both properly applied |
| **Strengths identification** | 8/8 valid | All correctly characterized |
| **Composite score (73/100)** | Defensible | Spec is fundamentally sound with precision failures |

### Error Classification

| Error Type | Count | Items |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **Direction error** | 1 | P0-1: spec.md hours should not go down; plan.md should go up |
| **Fabricated data** | 1 | Sprint 0 Blocker #2: NFR-P01 "<=5ms" — actual value is 500ms |
| **Severity overstatement** | 2 | Finding 5 (ADOPT items tracked but unnumbered), Finding 6 sub-claim on observer effect |
| **Unverifiable claim** | 1 | Sprint 0 Blocker #5: G3 line-number discrepancy not found |

### Conclusion

The 10-Agent Ultra-Think Review demonstrates that multi-agent review at this complexity level achieves approximately 80% accuracy — sufficient to identify all material issues but requiring single-agent verification to correct directional errors and fabricated claims. The review's fundamental assessment (73/100, architecturally sound, precision failures not design flaws) is correct and this verification confirms the spec folder is ready for Sprint 0 execution after the P0 amendments.

## Appendix: Cross-Reference of All Effort Figures

For definitive reference, here are all effort figures across all documents:

| Sprint | plan.md Header | plan.md Table | tasks.md Header | Actual Task Sum | Correct Value |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| S0 | 30-45h | 30-45h | (in 314-467h total) | 45-70h | **45-70h** |
| S1 | 22-31h | 22-31h | (in total) | 24-35h | **24-35h** |
| S2 | 19-29h | 19-29h | (in total) | 21-32h | **21-32h** |
| S3 | 26-40h | 26-40h | (in total) | 34-53h | **34-53h** |
| S4 | 39-56h | 39-56h | (in total) | 60-89h | **60-89h** |
| S5 | 64-92h | 64-92h | (in total) | 64-92h | **64-92h** |
| S6 | 68-101h | 68-101h | (in total) | 68-101h | **68-101h** |
| S7 | 45-62h | 45-62h | (in total) | 45-62h | **45-62h** |
| **S0-S6** | 270-395h | 268-394h | 314-467h | **316-472h** | **316-472h** |
| **S0-S7** | 313-456h | 313-456h | 355-524h | **361-534h** | **361-534h** |

The discrepancy source: plan.md effort headers were set before research/143-145 added tasks (A2, A7, A4, B2, B7, B8, D4). tasks.md and spec.md were updated; plan.md was not.
