## Executive Summary

Sprint 0 is the blocking foundation sprint for the entire Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement initiative. It carries dual objectives — (1) fixing three silent failures that corrupt retrieval quality (graph channel ID mismatch, chunk collapse dedup gap, co-activation hub domination), and (2) constructing the evaluation infrastructure that every downstream sprint will use to validate its changes. The sprint is structurally sound: two independent parallel tracks, a well-diagrammed dependency graph, and a rigorous 10-item P0 exit gate (CHK-060 through CHK-S0B).

However, three specific defects in the current documents will cause implementation problems if left unaddressed:

1. **REQ-S0-007 (eval-the-eval validation) has no corresponding task in `tasks.md`.** This requirement will be silently skipped.
2. **T007's acceptance criteria do not enforce the 20-manual-query hard gate** mandated by REQ-S0-004 and the spec's Exit Gate section, leaving circular evaluation bias only partially mitigated.
3. **A threshold inconsistency** between the 50-query ground truth target (T007) and the 100-query requirement for the BM25 contingency decision (REQ-S0-004, spec §5) creates an ambiguity that could result in a decision made on insufficient data.

Additionally, Phase 5 (PI-A5, 12–16h) represents 25–30% of total sprint effort yet carries only P1 priority. Deferral to Sprint 1 would not block any downstream sprint and is recommended.

## Multi-Lens Analysis

### Analytical Lens

**Track separation and dependency structure**

The two-track architecture (Bug Fixes / Eval Infrastructure) is cleanly conceived. Tracks 1 and 2 are genuinely independent at the code level — G1, G3, R17, and TM-02 touch three separate subsystems (`graph-search-fn.ts`, `memory-search.ts`, `co-activation.ts`, `memory-save.ts`) with no shared state, while the eval infrastructure creates an entirely new database file. The dependency diagram in `plan.md` §L2 accurately reflects this:

```
Phase 1 (Bug Fixes) ────────────────────┐
  G1, G3, R17 — parallel               │
                                         ├──► Phase 4 (Verification)
Phase 2 (Eval Infrastructure) ──────────┤
  Schema → Hooks → Metrics — sequential │
                              │         │
                              ▼         │
                    Phase 3 (Baseline) ─┘
```

Phase 2b (Agent Consumption Pre-Analysis) is correctly identified as an independent pre-requisite to Phase 3 rather than a dependency of Phase 2, allowing it to run in parallel with Track 2 infrastructure work.

**Effort accounting inconsistency**

The `plan.md` effort table (§L2: EFFORT ESTIMATION) sums to 32–48h for Phases 1–4:

| Phase | Low | High |
|-------|-----|------|
| Phase 1 (Bug Fixes) | 8h | 14h |
| Phase 2 (Eval Infrastructure) | 18h | 24h |
| Phase 3 (Baseline) | 6h | 10h |
| Phase 4 (Verification) | — | — |
| **Subtotal** | **32h** | **48h** |

Phase 5 (PI-A5) adds 12–16h, bringing the real total to **44–64h**. This is not reflected in the effort table, which only shows "32-48h" as its total. Any sprint capacity planning based on the documented figure is understating effort by 25–33%.

Within Phase 2, T006 (core metric computation) carries an estimate of 14–21h. This is effectively a mini-sprint within Sprint 0. Its subtasks (T006a through T006g) individually range from 1h to 6h across seven distinct metric implementations. No intermediate validation checkpoint is defined within T006 itself — the entire computation block runs to completion before any verification occurs.

**Dependency chain integrity**

Phase 2b correctly gates Phase 3 (T007b must complete before T007 proceeds). T009 (exit gate) correctly aggregates all upstream tasks: T001, T002, T003, T004, T005, T006, T007, T007b, T008, T054. The chain is sound.

### Critical Lens

**Finding C-1: REQ-S0-007 has no task (Missing task — will be skipped)**

REQ-S0-007 requires hand-calculation of MRR@5 for 5 randomly selected queries, then comparison against R13-computed values within ±0.01. This is the primary mechanism for detecting silent errors in the metric computation code.

`tasks.md` contains tasks T001–T009, T007b, T010–T012, and T054. There is no task for REQ-S0-007. The exit gate checklist (T009) does not include a line item for this requirement. CHK-023 ("Eval metric computation verified against known test data") is the closest analog but is marked P1 and does not specify the hand-calculation protocol defined in REQ-S0-007.

Without a task, this requirement has no owner, no acceptance criteria, no effort estimate, and no gate position in the dependency chain. It will not be executed.

**Finding C-2: T007 acceptance criteria do not enforce the 20-manual-query hard gate**

The spec's Exit Gate section (§5) states:

> Ground truth corpus MUST include: >=20 manually curated natural-language queries (NOT derived from trigger phrases — avoids circular validation bias per R-008)

REQ-S0-004 repeats this requirement: "Ground truth corpus satisfies diversity requirement: >=20 manually curated non-trigger-phrase queries."

T007's acceptance criteria states: "50+ queries with intent type and complexity tier tags; diversity thresholds met."

The 20-manual-query requirement is not enumerated in T007's acceptance criteria. T007's primary method is explicitly "Generate synthetic ground truth from trigger phrases." The acceptance criteria's reference to "diversity thresholds met" could be interpreted as satisfied by the intent-type and complexity-tier tags alone, without the 20-manual-query constraint.

The consequence: if an implementer satisfies T007's literal acceptance criteria (50+ queries, intent tags, complexity tiers, 3+ hard negatives), they may believe the task is complete while the 20-manual-query hard gate remains unmet. Circular bias from trigger-phrase-derived queries would then dominate the ground truth corpus.

Even with 20 manual queries in a 100-query corpus, 80 trigger-phrase-derived queries still represent 80% of the evaluation data. The spec's rationale (§5) correctly identifies this: "Synthetic ground truth derived from trigger phrases evaluates a system that retrieves partly via trigger phrases, inflating MRR@5 scores." The 20-manual-query floor is a minimum, not a target. Implementers should be directed toward maximizing the manual-query proportion, not just clearing the threshold.

**Finding C-3: 50-vs-100 query threshold inconsistency**

Three distinct query-count thresholds appear across the documents:

| Location | Threshold | Context |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| REQ-S0-003 | 50 queries | "Baseline metrics computed for at least 50 queries" |
| T007 acceptance | 50+ queries | "50+ queries with intent type and complexity tier tags" |
| REQ-S0-004 | >=100 queries | "BM25 contingency decision requires ... >=100 diverse queries" |
| Spec §5 Exit Gate | >=100 total | ">=100 total diverse queries for BM25 contingency decision" |
| CHK-062 | 50+ queries | "Baseline MRR@5... computed for 50+ queries" |

The BM25 contingency decision is the "most consequential decision in the plan" (spec §5 rationale). It requires >=100 diverse queries at p<0.05 statistical significance. However, T007 targets only 50 queries, and CHK-062 (the exit gate item for this) only verifies 50+ queries in `eval_results`. An implementer who satisfies T007 and CHK-062 will have insufficient data for the BM25 contingency decision defined in REQ-S0-004 and CHK-064.

The resolution path is not documented. T007 would need to either: (a) target 100+ queries from the start, or (b) be split into T007 (50-query baseline batch) and T007c (50-query BM25 expansion batch) with T007c gating CHK-064 rather than CHK-062.

**Finding C-4: T006 lacks an intermediate validation checkpoint**

T006 spans 14–21h across seven subtasks (T006a through T006g). CHK-023 ("Eval metric computation verified against known test data") is P1 and provides no specification of what "known test data" means, what the source is, or how many data points are required.

If MRR@5 computation has a subtle implementation error (e.g., incorrect tie-breaking, off-by-one in the ranking window), all 50+ baseline measurements will be silently wrong. The error would only surface when REQ-S0-007's hand-calculation is performed — but REQ-S0-007 has no task (Finding C-1), so it may never be performed.

The specific gap: CHK-023 does not specify a test data source with known ground truth values. Without a fixed test case (e.g., "query A with known relevant memories M1, M2, M3 at ranks 1, 3, 5 should produce MRR@5 = 0.467"), the check cannot be deterministically verified.

### Holistic Lens

**Sprint 0 correctly gates all downstream work**

The exit gate design is the strongest aspect of this sprint document. Ten P0 hard blockers (CHK-060 through CHK-S0B) create a non-negotiable quality floor. Each item specifies: what to verify, how to verify it (HOW: clauses), and what evidence is required. This level of specificity is uncommon in sprint documentation and directly addresses the "pure speculation" problem identified in the problem statement.

**BM25 contingency decision is structurally well-designed**

The three-path decision matrix (PAUSE if >=80%, rationalize if 50-80%, PROCEED if <50%) is a clean mechanism for handling the most uncertain outcome in the plan. The "rationalize" path at 50–80% is underspecified — the spec does not define what rationalization entails, who makes the decision, or what the output artifact is — but the structure itself is sound.

**Phase 2b (Agent Consumption Pre-Analysis) is a genuine improvement**

Including a pre-analysis of agent query patterns before ground truth generation is methodologically correct. Ground truth that reflects real agent consumption patterns is significantly more predictive of production retrieval quality than ground truth derived purely from trigger phrases. The 3–4h effort is proportionate to the value.

**PI-A5 is scope creep for a foundation sprint**

Phase 5 (PI-A5, Verify-Fix-Verify for Memory Quality) carries 12–16h of effort at P1 priority. The spec.md rationale for including it in Sprint 0 — "once you can measure quality, you can enforce it at index time" — is valid in principle. However, the feature is explicitly P1 (Required with user-approved deferral), not P0. It is not in the handoff criteria. It is not referenced by any downstream sprint as a prerequisite. Deferring it to Sprint 1 would save 12–16h from Sprint 0 without blocking any subsequent sprint. Sprint 0 already carries 32–48h (or 44–64h including PI-A5) of work for what is classified as a foundation sprint.

The SHA256 content-hash dedup (TM-02, T054) that PI-A5 depends on is correctly in Sprint 0. PI-A5 itself is not.

## Key Findings

### Top Risks

**Risk 1 (Severity: Critical) — Missing task for REQ-S0-007**

REQ-S0-007 (eval-the-eval validation by hand-calculation) has no corresponding task in `tasks.md`. This requirement will not be executed. The entire metric computation subsystem (T006, 14–21h) can silently produce incorrect values with no detection mechanism.

Remediation: Add task T013 — "Hand-calculate MRR@5 for 5 randomly selected queries and compare to R13 output (tolerance ±0.01). Resolve discrepancies before proceeding to T008." Effort: 2–3h. Gate position: after T006, before T008. Add CHK-069 [P0] to exit gate.

**Risk 2 (Severity: High) — Circular bias undercount in T007**

T007's acceptance criteria do not enforce the 20-manual-query hard gate. An implementer can satisfy T007's literal criteria with zero manually curated queries. Even at the 20-query floor, 80% of a 100-query corpus remains trigger-phrase-derived, meaning circular bias is reduced but not eliminated.

Remediation: Add explicit acceptance criteria to T007: ">=20 queries MUST be manually curated natural-language queries NOT derived from trigger phrases (per REQ-S0-004 hard gate). Document the manual vs synthetic query split in the query distribution table." Consider raising the manual-query floor to 30–40 for a 100-query corpus.

**Risk 3 (Severity: High) — 50-vs-100 query threshold inconsistency**

T007 targets 50 queries; REQ-S0-004 and the exit gate for the BM25 contingency decision require 100 queries. CHK-062 (which verifies query count) checks for 50+, not 100+. An implementer satisfying T007 and CHK-062 will have insufficient data for CHK-064.

Remediation: Align T007 target to ">=100 total query-relevance pairs for BM25 contingency decision; 50 minimum for initial baseline metrics." Update CHK-062 to distinguish between: (a) 50+ queries for baseline metrics, and (b) 100+ diverse queries required before CHK-064 (BM25 contingency decision) can be resolved.

### Top Strengths

**Strength 1 — Exit gate rigor**

Ten P0 hard blockers with specific evidence requirements, HOW clauses, and cross-references to tasks. The checklist structure mirrors the exit gate section in the spec, creating dual verification. This is the primary mechanism preventing premature sprint closure.

**Strength 2 — Phase 2b agent consumption pre-analysis**

Ground truth designed around real agent consumption patterns is a methodologically sound approach. The fallback strategy (manual enumeration from CLAUDE.md and skill definitions if no logs are available) prevents a blocking dependency on data availability.

**Strength 3 — Statistical significance requirement for BM25 decision**

Requiring p<0.05 (paired t-test or bootstrap 95% CI) before the BM25 contingency decision is made prevents a premature roadmap pivot based on noise. Most comparable specifications omit statistical significance requirements entirely. This is the correct epistemic standard for the most consequential binary decision in the 8-sprint plan.
