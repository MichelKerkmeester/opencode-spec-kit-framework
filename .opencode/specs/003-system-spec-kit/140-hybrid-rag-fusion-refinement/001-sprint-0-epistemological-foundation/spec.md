### Phase Context

This is **Phase 1** of the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement specification.

**Scope Boundary**: Sprint 0 scope boundary — BLOCKING foundation sprint. All downstream sprints depend on the evaluation infrastructure and bug fixes delivered here.

**Dependencies**:
- None (Sprint 0 is the first phase — no predecessors)

**Deliverables**:
- Functional graph channel (G1 ID format fix)
- Chunk dedup fix (G3 all code paths)
- Fan-effect divisor for co-activation hub domination (R17)
- Evaluation infrastructure with 5-table schema (R13-S1)
- BM25-only baseline measurement (G-NEW-1)

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

The graph channel is completely broken — 0% hit rate in production due to `mem:${edgeId}` string IDs being compared against numeric memory IDs. The chunk collapse dedup logic only runs on the `includeContent=true` path, allowing duplicate chunks to surface in default search mode (`includeContent=false`). Co-activation scoring suffers from hub domination where highly-connected memories dominate results regardless of query relevance. Most critically, zero evaluation metrics exist — every tuning decision is pure speculation.

### Purpose

Establish measurable retrieval quality by fixing silent failures blocking all downstream improvement, and create the evaluation infrastructure that gates every subsequent sprint's changes.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

- **G1**: Fix graph channel ID format — convert `mem:${edgeId}` to numeric memory IDs
- **G3**: Fix chunk collapse conditional — dedup on ALL code paths including `includeContent=false`
- **R17**: Add fan-effect divisor to co-activation scoring to reduce hub domination
- **R13-S1**: Evaluation infrastructure — separate SQLite DB with 5-table schema, logging hooks, core metrics (MRR@5, NDCG@10, Recall@20, Hit Rate@1)
- **G-NEW-1**: BM25-only baseline comparison and measurement

### Out of Scope

- R4 (typed-degree channel) — requires Sprint 0 evaluation infrastructure first; Sprint 1 scope
- All scoring/fusion changes — require eval infrastructure to validate; Sprint 2+ scope
- R11 (learned relevance feedback) — requires R13 running 2+ eval cycles; Sprint 4 scope
- Pipeline refactoring — Sprint 5 scope

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `graph-search-fn.ts` | Modify | G1: Fix ID format from `mem:${edgeId}` to numeric |
| `memory-search.ts` | Modify | G3: Fix chunk collapse to run on all code paths |
| `composite-scoring.ts` | Modify | R17: Add fan-effect divisor to co-activation |
| `speckit-eval.db` | Create | R13-S1: Evaluation database with 5-table schema |
| Eval handler files | Create | R13-S1: Logging hooks for search/context/trigger handlers |

## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: Graph hit rate > 0% (from 0% baseline) after G1 fix
- **SC-002**: No duplicate chunk rows appear in default search mode after G3 fix
- **SC-003**: Baseline MRR@5, NDCG@10, Recall@20 computed and stored for 50+ queries
- **SC-004**: BM25 baseline MRR@5 recorded; BM25 contingency decision made
- **SC-005**: Sprint 0 exit gate — all 4 P0 requirements verified

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | G1 fix reveals sparse graph — few or no edges exist | Low | Not a failure — informs Sprint 1 density decision; R4 correctly returns zero |
| Risk | R13-S1 is largest item (20-28h) — scope creep possible | Medium | Strict 5-table schema; defer advanced features to R13-S2 (Sprint 4) |
| Risk | BM25 >= 80% of hybrid MRR@5 — challenges multi-channel approach | High | Decision matrix defined: PAUSE if >=80%, rationalize if 50-80%, PROCEED if <50% |
| Dependency | None | N/A | Sprint 0 is first phase — no external dependencies |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Eval logging MUST NOT add >5ms p95 to search latency
- **NFR-P02**: G1 fix must not degrade graph search performance

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Eval DB (`speckit-eval.db`) MUST be separate from primary DB — no observer effect
- **NFR-S02**: No eval queries touch the primary database

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: G1 and G3 fixes must not break existing 158+ tests
- **NFR-R02**: Eval infrastructure degrades gracefully — search continues if eval DB is unavailable
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- **Empty graph after G1 fix**: Correct behavior — R4 produces zero scores for all memories; graph channel returns empty results
- **N=0 queries for BM25 baseline**: Requires minimum 50 queries with ground truth; synthetic generation from trigger phrases covers this

### Error Scenarios
- **Eval DB creation failure**: Search continues unaffected; eval logging disabled with warning
- **Zero graph edges found**: Graph search returns empty — not an error post-G1 fix

### State Transitions
- **Partial R13-S1 completion**: Schema without hooks = usable but no automatic logging; hooks can be added incrementally
- **BM25 contingency trigger**: If BM25 >= 80% of hybrid — halt Sprint 1+ planning, escalate to project lead

## 9. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Scope | 15/25 | 5 files across 3 subsystems (graph, search, eval), schema creation |
| Risk | 12/25 | BM25 contingency could alter roadmap; eval DB is new subsystem |
| Research | 8/20 | Research complete (142 analysis); code locations identified |
| **Total** | **35/70** | **Level 2** |
<!-- /ANCHOR:complexity -->

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

- **OQ-S0-001**: What is the actual edge count in the graph after G1 fix? Will determine if Sprint 1 R4 has meaningful data to work with.
- **OQ-S0-002**: Synthetic ground truth quality — are trigger phrases sufficient for initial baseline, or do we need manual relevance annotations?
