<!-- ANCHOR:sprint-6a -->
## Sprint 6a: Practical Improvements (R7, R16, S4, T001d, N3-lite) — 33-51h

- [ ] T001d **MR10 mitigation: weight_history audit tracking** — add `weight_history` column or log weight changes to eval DB for N3-lite Hebbian modifications; enables rollback of weight changes independent of edge creation [2-3h] — MR10 (REQUIRED — promoted from risk mitigation)
  - Acceptance: all N3-lite weight modifications logged with before/after values, timestamps, and affected edge IDs; rollback script can restore weights from history
  - Rationale: without weight_history, cumulative rollback to pre-S6 state is practically impossible after Hebbian weight modifications
- [ ] T003 [P] Implement anchor-aware chunk thinning [10-15h] — R7 (REQ-S6-001)
  - Sub-steps: (1) Parse anchor markers in indexed content. (2) Score chunks by anchor presence + content density. (3) Apply thinning threshold — drop chunks below score cutoff. (4) Run Recall@20 eval before/after.
  - Acceptance criteria: Recall@20 within 10% of pre-thinning baseline on eval query set.
- [ ] T004 [P] Implement encoding-intent capture behind `SPECKIT_ENCODING_INTENT` flag [5-8h] — R16 (REQ-S6-002)
  - Sub-steps: (1) Add `encoding_intent` field to memory index schema. (2) Classify intent at index time (code, prose, structured data). (3) Store alongside embedding. (4) Expose in retrieval metadata (read-only; no retrieval-time scoring impact — index-only capture).
  - Acceptance criteria: `encoding_intent` field populated for all newly indexed memories when flag is enabled. Note: R16 captures intent at index time for metadata enrichment; it does not influence retrieval scoring in Sprint 6.
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement spec folder hierarchy as retrieval structure [6-10h] — S4 (REQ-S6-006)
  - Sub-steps: (1) Parse spec folder path from memory metadata. (2) Build in-memory hierarchy tree at query time (or cached). (3) Add hierarchy-aware traversal to `graph-search-fn.ts`. (4) Return parent/sibling memories as contextual results.
  - Acceptance criteria: hierarchy traversal returns parent-folder memories when queried from a child spec folder; functional in at least 1 integration test.
- [ ] T002 Implement N3-lite: contradiction scan + Hebbian strengthening + staleness detection with edge caps [9-14h] {T001d} [HARD GATE — T001d MUST be complete and verified before any T002 sub-task begins] — N3-lite (REQ-S6-005)
  > **ESTIMATION WARNING**: ~40 LOC for contradiction scan assumes heuristic (cosine similarity + keyword conflict). Semantic accuracy >80% requires NLI model — effort 3-5x. Clarify threshold before implementing.
  - T002a Contradiction scan (cosine >0.85 + keyword negation) [3-4h] {T001d}
    - Sub-steps: (1) Candidate generation — cosine similarity >0.85 pair query. (2) Conflict check — keyword negation heuristic (contains "not", "never", contradicts prior claim). (3) Flag pair + surface cluster. (4) Write `contradiction_flag` to memory record.
    - Acceptance criteria: detects at least 1 known contradiction in curated test data (manually seeded pair).
  - T002b Hebbian edge strengthening (+0.05/cycle, caps) + 30-day decay [2-3h] {T001d}
    - +0.05 per validation cycle, MAX_STRENGTH_INCREASE=0.05, 30-day decay of 0.1 (~20 LOC)
    - Acceptance criteria: weight changes logged to weight_history before and after each modification.
    - Test: verify 30-day decay reduces edge strength by 0.1 — edge at strength 0.8 with last_accessed >30 days ago decays to 0.7 on next consolidation cycle.
  - T002c Staleness detection (90-day unfetched edges) [1-2h] {T001d}
    - Flag edges unfetched for 90+ days (~15 LOC)
    - Acceptance criteria: stale edges identified and flagged without deletion.
  - T002d Edge bounds enforcement (MAX_EDGES=20, auto cap 0.5) [1-2h] {T001d}
    - MAX_EDGES_PER_NODE=20, auto edges capped at strength=0.5, track `created_by`
    - Acceptance criteria: 21st auto-edge rejected; manual edges unaffected.
  - T002e Contradiction cluster surfacing (all members) [2-3h] {T002a}
    - When contradiction detected (similarity >0.85), surface ALL cluster members (not just flagged pair) to agent for resolution (~25 LOC)
    - Acceptance criteria: all members of contradiction cluster returned, not just the detected pair.

## Sprint 6b: Graph Sophistication (N2, R10) — 37-53h (GATED)

- [ ] T-S6-SPIKE Algorithm feasibility spike — validate N2c and R10 approaches on actual data [8-16h] {T007a}
  - Determine: (a) whether Louvain is appropriate at current graph density, or whether connected components suffices; (b) whether rule-based entity extraction meets the <20% FP threshold on a representative sample
  - Acceptance: spike report documenting graph density, algorithm recommendation, and quality tier (heuristic vs production) decision
- [ ] T-S6B-GATE [GATE-PRE] Sprint 6b entry gate — T-S6-SPIKE completed, OQ-S6-001 resolved (edge density documented), OQ-S6-002 resolved (centrality algorithm selected with evidence), REQ-S6-004 revisited (10% mandate density-conditioned) [0h] {T-S6-SPIKE}

- [ ] T001 Implement graph centrality + community detection — N2 items 4-6 [25-35h] {T-S6B-GATE} — N2 (REQ-S6-004)
  > **ESTIMATION WARNING**: N2c listed at 12-15h; production-quality Louvain on SQLite requires 40-80h. Start with connected components (BFS, ~20 LOC) and escalate only if separation is insufficient.
  - T001a N2a: Graph Momentum (Temporal Degree Delta) — compute degree change over sliding 7-day window; surface memories with accelerating connectivity [8-12h]
    - Sub-steps: (1) Add `degree_snapshot` table to store daily degree counts. (2) Compute delta = current_degree - degree_7d_ago. (3) Surface top-N memories by delta magnitude.
    - Acceptance criteria: momentum score computed for all nodes with >=1 edge; top-10 most-connected recent memories identifiable.
  - T001b N2b: Causal Depth Signal — max-depth path from root memories; deeper = more derived; normalize by graph diameter [5-8h]
    - Sub-steps: (1) Identify root nodes (in-degree=0 in causal_edges). (2) BFS/DFS to compute max-depth for each node. (3) Normalize by graph diameter. (4) Expose as `causal_depth_score` field.
    - Acceptance criteria: causal_depth_score assigned to all nodes; root nodes score=0; leaf nodes score=1.0.
  - T001c N2c: Community Detection — identify memory clusters via connected components first, then Louvain if needed; boost intra-community recall [12-15h heuristic / 40-80h Louvain]
    - Algorithm references: Connected components — standard BFS, no library. Louvain — `igraph` (Python) or `graphology-communities-louvain` (npm). Export SQLite adjacency list to in-memory graph before running.
    - Sub-steps: (1) Export edge list from `causal_edges`. (2) Run connected-components BFS. (3) Evaluate cluster quality (avg cluster size, silhouette proxy). (4) Escalate to Louvain only if clusters are too coarse (avg size >50% of graph).
    - Acceptance criteria: community assignments stable across 2 consecutive runs on the same data (deterministic or jitter <5% membership change).
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement auto entity extraction (gated on density <1.0) behind `SPECKIT_AUTO_ENTITIES` flag [12-18h heuristic / 30-50h ML] {T-S6B-GATE} — R10 (REQ-S6-003)
  > **ESTIMATION WARNING**: 12-18h assumes rule-based heuristics (noun-phrase extraction via `compromise` npm or `spaCy` if available). FP <20% is an ML challenge; escalate to fine-tuned NER only if heuristic FP >20% on sample review.
  - Sub-steps: (1) Measure current edge density (gate check). (2) Implement noun-phrase NER using rule-based library. (3) Tag extracted entities with `created_by='auto'`, strength=0.5. (4) Manual FP review on sample of >=50 entities. (5) Disable flag and remove auto-entities if FP >20%.
  - Algorithm references: Rule-based — `compromise` npm (lightweight, no model download). ML-based — `wink-nlp` or `node-nlp`. Python bridge — `spaCy` en_core_web_sm for higher accuracy.
  - Acceptance criteria: FP rate <20% verified on manual review of >=50 randomly sampled auto-extracted entities; all entities tagged `created_by='auto'`.
