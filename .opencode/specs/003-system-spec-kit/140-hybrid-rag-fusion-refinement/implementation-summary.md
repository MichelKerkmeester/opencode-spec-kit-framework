## What Was Built

This program delivered phased retrieval-system refinement across eight sprints, moving the memory stack from unvalidated mixed-scoring behavior to a metric-gated and auditable pipeline. Work includes graph-signal activation, scoring calibration, query-intelligence routing, feedback/quality controls, pipeline refactor steps, indexing/graph deepening, and long-horizon evaluation tooling.

Recent completion work also addressed late remediation and alignment items:

- Sprint 5 scoring metadata integration and Sprint 7 evaluation reporting tool wiring.
- Canonical policy alignment in `sk-code--opencode` for header terminology, AI-intent comment policy severity, and JSONC allowlist consistency.
- Sprint-140 documentation synchronization for priority mappings, feature-flag budget language, and sunset-gate deduplication.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery used phased spec folders and sprint-gate validation with focused remediation cycles. Changes were kept bounded by finding matrices (global policy vs local spec updates), then checked through independent review and validator runs.

For validator-debt work, template-source metadata was normalized across affected root/phase docs, root-level required artifacts were restored, and non-compliant TOC usage was removed from non-research files.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep canonical policy changes small and targeted | Reduce drift without forcing broad rewrite risk |
| Treat comment/header style enforcement as manual checklist gate in current pass | Minimize verifier churn while preserving explicit governance |
| Resolve validator errors before further sprint closure claims | Prevent false "complete" signaling for Level 3+ spec folder |

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Alignment policy updates applied in scoped files | PASS |
| Independent read-only review run for scoped updates | PASS with one P1, then remediated |
| Sprint-140 validator debt triage completed | PASS (pre-existing debt confirmed, then addressed in this pass) |
| Root required files present (`decision-record.md`, `implementation-summary.md`) | PASS |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. Validator warnings may remain for non-blocking quality checks (for example evidence density and advisory protocol coverage).
2. Workspace includes unrelated tracked runtime artifacts (`speckit-eval.db-wal`/`speckit-eval.db-shm`) that were not produced by this documentation pass but are included when committing "all files."
