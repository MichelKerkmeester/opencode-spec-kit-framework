<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Three ultra-think agents independently identified critical gaps in Spec 140: (1) no data model for R13 eval infrastructure, (2) circular ground truth validation bias, (3) scope disproportionality (458-700h for <2000 memories), (4) Sprint 4 violates max-2-subsystems principle, (5) sprint-spec drift with requirements only in child specs; solution: Applied 28 prioritized actions (7 P0, 12 P1, 4 P2, 5 INC fixes) across parent spec + 5 child sprint specs.

## 2. OVERVIEW

Implemented 28 spec amendments across 10 files from a tri-agent ultra-think review of the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement spec (Spec 140). Three independent ultra-think agents (using Analytical/Critical/Holistic/Pragmatic lenses) reviewed the full spec folder and converged on critical issues: circular ground truth validation bias, missing data model, scope disproportionality, Sprint 4 subsystem violation, and sprint-spec drift. All P0 (7 actions), P1 (12 actions), and P2 (4 actions) were applied to spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, and 5 child sprint specs. Key additions: R13 5-table SQL schema definition, signal application order document, build-gate vs enable-gate classification, Sprint 4 mandatory split, eval-the-eval validation requirement, and contingent phase reframing of Sprints 4-7.

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Three ultra-think agents independently identified critical gaps in Spec 140: (1) no data model for R13 eval infrastructure, (2) circular ground truth validation bias, (3) scope disproportionality (458-700h for <2000 memories), (4) Sprint 4 violates max-2-subsystems principle, (5) sprint-spec drift with requirements only in child specs; solution: Applied 28 prioritized actions (7 P0, 12 P1, 4 P2, 5 INC fixes) across parent spec + 5 child sprint specs. Key structural additions: R13 schema DDL, consolidated signal application order, build/enable gate classification, contingent phase reframing, eval-the-eval validation, interaction pair verification items, negative test items, rollback verification items; patterns: Cross-agent convergence analysis (3 agents × 4 lenses), prioritized action items (P0/P1/P2), systematic file-by-file amendment with cross-document consistency verification

## 4. DECISIONS

<!-- ANCHOR:decision-explicit-r13-c65e1f53 -->
### Decision 1: Decision: Added explicit R13 5

**Context**: table evaluation schema DDL (eval_queries, eval_channel_results, eval_final_results, eval_ground_truth, eval_metric_snapshots) to spec.md §4.1 — because the spec referenced a '5-table schema' without ever defining tables, columns, or relationships, and all 7 subsequent sprints depend on this infrastructure

### Decision 2: Decision: Elevated R

**Context**: 008 (ground truth bias) and R-011 (measurement reliability) from Medium to High severity — because synthetic ground truth derived from trigger phrases evaluates a system that retrieves partly via trigger phrases, creating circular validation bias that could inflate MRR@5 scores and corrupt the BM25 contingency decision

### Message Timeline

> **User** | 2026-02-27 @ 08:05:53

Implemented 28 spec amendments across 10 files from a tri-agent ultra-think review of the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement spec (Spec 140). Three independent ultra-think agents (using Analytical/Critical/Holistic/Pragmatic lenses) reviewed the full spec folder and converged on critical issues: circular ground truth validation bias, missing data model, scope disproportionality, Sprint 4 subsystem violation, and sprint-spec drift. All P0 (7 actions), P1 (12 actions), and P2 (4 actions) were applied to spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, and 5 child sprint specs. Key additions: R13 5-table SQL schema definition, signal application order document, build-gate vs enable-gate classification, Sprint 4 mandatory split, eval-the-eval validation requirement, and contingent phase reframing of Sprints 4-7.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
