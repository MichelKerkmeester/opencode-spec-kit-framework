<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed Phase 11 (Verification) of the comprehensive 10-phase documentation audit and remediation plan for the hybrid RAG fusion refinement spec folder. This session continued from a previous session that completed Phases 1-10 (root document fixes, 8 sprint sub-folder fixes, 3 folder renames). Fixed remaining stale references: trigger-extractor.ts → trigger-matcher.ts in root spec.md and tasks.md; updated epistemological-foundation → measurement-foundation in Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 cross-references; updated feedback-loop → feedback-and-quality and graph-deepening → indexing-and-graph in Sprint 3, 5, 7, and 8 spec.md files. Resolved the PI-A5 orphan by adding it formally to Sprint 1's spec.md, tasks.md, and checklist.md (was deferred from Sprint 0 per REC-09 but never added to Sprint 1). Ran 8 verification checks via parallel agents: stale folder refs (PASS), effort consistency (PASS), feature flag ceiling (PASS), dependency chain S0→S7 (PASS), PI-A5/G-NEW-3/B8 resolution (FIXED/PASS/PASS), and scoring signal count analysis (INFO - B8 ceiling potentially exceeded at S2+, tracked by CHK-B8 items).

rootCause: Phase 11 verification revealed stale folder name references in Sprint 1-3, 5, 7, 8 child spec files that were not updated during Phase 10 folder renaming; also discovered PI-A5 was missing from Sprint 1 despite REQ-057 requiring it; solution: Fixed all stale references via replace_all edits on affected files; added PI-A5 as T008 to Sprint 1 tasks.md, added to spec.md scope and files-to-change table, added checklist item, updated P1 count; patterns: Parallel agent verification pattern: dispatched 3-5 specialized Explore agents simultaneously for different verification checks (stale refs, effort numbers, feature flags, dependency chain, orphan features, signal counts) to maximize throughput

## 4. DECISIONS

<!-- ANCHOR:decision-trigger-2cbd3575 -->
### Decision 1: Decision: Fixed trigger

**Context**: extractor.ts → trigger-matcher.ts only in active spec/plan/tasks files, not in research files (historical records) because research files document what existed at analysis time

### Message Timeline

> **User** | 2026-02-27 @ 09:48:18

Completed Phase 11 (Verification) of the comprehensive 10-phase documentation audit and remediation plan for the hybrid RAG fusion refinement spec folder. This session continued from a previous session that completed Phases 1-10 (root document fixes, 8 sprint sub-folder fixes, 3 folder renames). Fixed remaining stale references: trigger-extractor.ts → trigger-matcher.ts in root spec.md and tasks.md; updated epistemological-foundation → measurement-foundation in Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 cross-references; updated feedback-loop → feedback-and-quality and graph-deepening → indexing-and-graph in Sprint 3, 5, 7, and 8 spec.md files. Resolved the PI-A5 orphan by adding it formally to Sprint 1's spec.md, tasks.md, and checklist.md (was deferred from Sprint 0 per REC-09 but never added to Sprint 1). Ran 8 verification checks via parallel agents: stale folder refs (PASS), effort consistency (PASS), feature flag ceiling (PASS), dependency chain S0→S7 (PASS), PI-A5/G-NEW-3/B8 resolution (FIXED/PASS/PASS), and scoring signal count analysis (INFO - B8 ceiling potentially exceeded at S2+, tracked by CHK-B8 items).

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
