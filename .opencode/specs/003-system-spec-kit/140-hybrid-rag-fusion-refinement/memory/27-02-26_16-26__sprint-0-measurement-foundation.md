<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Sprint 0 had 3 PARTIAL exit gates (3, 5, 6) blocked by: (a) placeholder memory IDs (-1) in ground truth, (b) no live DB execution.

**Common Patterns**:

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Graceful Fallback**: Provide sensible defaults when primary method fails

- **Functional Transforms**: Use functional methods for data transformation

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed Sprint 0 closure for the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement initiative. Executed BM25-only baseline against live production DB (2370 memories, 110 ground truth queries). Results: MRR@5=0.2083, contingency decision=PROCEED (statistically significant, bootstrap 95% CI [0.1458, 0.2752], p<0.05). All 8 exit gates now PASS. Also fixed two known issues: (1) added evaluateContingencyRelative() for spec-compliant ratio-based comparison alongside the absolute Sprint 0 mode, and (2) corrected relevanceWeight from 0.2 to 0.5 in search-weights.json (weights were transposed with recencyWeight). Created run-bm25-baseline.ts runner script and map-ground-truth-ids.ts mapping script. Total: 4883 tests passing, zero regressions.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Completed Sprint 0 closure for the Hybrid RAG Fusion Refinement initiative. Executed BM25-only...
- Decision: BM25 contingency = PROCEED because MRR@5=0.
- Decision: Added evaluateContingencyRelative() as new function rather than modify
- Decision: Fixed relevanceWeight from 0.
- Decision: Mapped ground truth IDs via multi-strategy FTS5 search against product
- Decision: Used percentile bootstrap with 10K iterations for statistical signific

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Sprint 0 had 3 PARTIAL exit gates (3, 5, 6) blocked by: (a) placeholder memory IDs (-1) in ground truth, (b) no live DB execution. Two known issues: absolute vs relative contingency thresholds, and transposed smart ranking weights.; solution: Mapped 297 real production memory IDs via FTS5. Created run-bm25-baseline.ts runner script. Executed against live DB: MRR@5=0.2083, PROCEED. Added evaluateContingencyRelative() for Sprint 1+ ratio-based comparison. Fixed relevanceWeight 0.2→0.5.; patterns: Dependency injection pattern for BM25SearchFn adapter. Percentile bootstrap for statistical significance. Multi-strategy FTS5 matching for ID resolution.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/001-sprint-0-measurement-foundation` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/001-sprint-0-measurement-foundation" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/001-sprint-0-measurement-foundation", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/001-sprint-0-measurement-foundation/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/140-hybrid-rag-fusion-refinement/001-sprint-0-measurement-foundation --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
