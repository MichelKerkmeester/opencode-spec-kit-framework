# Verification Checklist: Sprint 1 — Graph Signal Activation

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [ ] CHK-001 [P0] Sprint 0 exit gate verified as passed — HOW: Confirm all Sprint 0 CHK-060 through CHK-068 items are marked [x] with evidence. Cross-ref Sprint 0 checklist.md.
- [ ] CHK-002 [P0] R4 formula and edge type weights confirmed from research — HOW: Verify formula matches `typed_degree(node) = SUM(weight_t * count_t)` with weights caused=1.0, derived_from=0.9, enabled=0.8, contradicts=0.7, supersedes=0.6, supports=0.5. Cross-ref T001.
- [ ] CHK-003 [P1] `causal_edges` table structure verified and queryable — HOW: Run `SELECT * FROM causal_edges LIMIT 5` to confirm table exists and has expected columns (source_id, target_id, relation, strength, evidence).
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [ ] CHK-010 [P0] R4 dark-run: no single memory appears in >60% of results — HOW: Run R4 dark-run over 50+ eval queries; compute per-memory presence frequency; verify max < 60%. Evidence required: frequency distribution table. Cross-ref T005.
- [ ] CHK-011 [P0] R4 MRR@5 delta >+2% absolute over Sprint 0 baseline — HOW: Three-measurement sequence: (a) Sprint 0 baseline MRR@5, (b) R4-only dark-run with A7 at original 0.1x, (c) R4+A7 dark-run with A7 at 0.25-0.3x. Evidence required: three-point metric comparison table with isolated R4 and A7 contributions. Cross-ref T005.
- [ ] CHK-012 [P1] Constitutional memories excluded from degree boost — HOW: Query a known constitutional memory; verify degree score = 0 regardless of edge count. Cross-ref T001.
- [ ] CHK-013 [P1] MAX_TYPED_DEGREE cached and refreshed on graph mutation (not per-query) — HOW: Add edge via `memory_causal_link`; verify cache invalidation; run query before and after to confirm fresh computation. Cross-ref T001.
- [ ] CHK-014 [P1] Degree scores capped at DEGREE_BOOST_CAP=0.15 — HOW: Construct test case with high-degree node (>50 edges); verify output score <= 0.15. Cross-ref T001.

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [ ] CHK-020 [P0] 18-25 new tests added and passing
- [ ] CHK-021 [P0] 158+ existing tests still pass
- [ ] CHK-022 [P1] Degree SQL tested against known edge data (expected scores verified)
- [ ] CHK-023 [P1] Normalization output verified in [0, 0.15] range
- [ ] CHK-024 [P1] Cache invalidation tested (stale after mutation, fresh after recompute)
- [ ] CHK-025 [P1] NFR-P01: R4 degree computation adds <10ms p95 to search latency — measured
- [ ] CHK-026 [P1] NFR-R02: R4 gracefully returns 0 when memory has zero edges (no errors thrown)
- [ ] CHK-027 [P1] Co-activation boost strength (A7) — effective contribution >=15% at hop 2 verified in dark-run. **Attribution**: Measure A7 contribution using three-measurement sequence (R4-only pass vs R4+A7 pass delta). Evidence required: A7-isolated contribution percentage. Cross-ref T005, CHK-011.

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [ ] CHK-030 [P0] R4 behind feature flag `SPECKIT_DEGREE_BOOST` — disabled by default
- [ ] CHK-031 [P1] No degree boost applied to constitutional tier memories
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [ ] CHK-040 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized and reflect final implementation
- [ ] CHK-041 [P1] Edge density measurement and R10 escalation decision documented
- [ ] CHK-042 [P2] R4 formula and parameters documented for future reference
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [ ] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only
- [ ] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion
- [ ] CHK-052 [P2] Sprint 1 findings saved to memory/
<!-- /ANCHOR:file-org -->

---

## PageIndex Integration

- [ ] PI-A3 [P1]: Pre-flight token budget validation active in result assembler — candidate set truncated to highest-scoring results when total tokens exceed budget; `includeContent=true` single-result overflow returns summary fallback; all overflow events logged with query_id, candidate_count, total_tokens, budget_limit, and truncated_to_count

---

## Sprint 1 Exit Gate

- [ ] CHK-060 [P0] R4 MRR@5 delta >+2% absolute — verified via R13 eval metrics. **Density-conditional**: If T003 edge density < 0.5, gate evaluates R4 implementation correctness (unit tests pass, zero-return for unconnected memories) and records "R4 signal limited by graph sparsity — R10 escalation triggered" with density-adjusted threshold. Gate distinguishes implementation failure from data insufficiency. If density >= 0.5 and MRR@5 delta < +2%, gate fails as implementation issue.
- [ ] CHK-061 [P0] No single memory >60% presence in dark-run results
- [ ] CHK-062 [P0] Edge density measured; R10 escalation decision made if density < 0.5
- [ ] CHK-063 [P1] G-NEW-2 consumption instrumentation active and logging patterns
- [ ] CHK-064 [P1] Feature flag `SPECKIT_DEGREE_BOOST` permanently enabled (or disable-decision documented)
- [ ] CHK-065 [P2] TM-08 signal vocabulary expanded — CORRECTION ("actually", "wait", "I was wrong") and PREFERENCE ("prefer", "like", "want") categories classified correctly in `trigger-matcher.ts`
- [ ] CHK-066 [P1] Active feature flag count <=6 verified at sprint exit — HOW: grep codebase for `SPECKIT_` env var flags; count active (non-deprecated) flags; document list. Evidence required: flag inventory with count. New flags introduced in Sprint 1: `SPECKIT_DEGREE_BOOST`, `SPECKIT_COACTIVATION_STRENGTH`.
