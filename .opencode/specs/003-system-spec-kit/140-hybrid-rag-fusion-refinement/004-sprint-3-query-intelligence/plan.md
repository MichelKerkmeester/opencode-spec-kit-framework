# Implementation Plan: Sprint 3 — Query Intelligence

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core + level2-verify | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript |
| **Storage** | SQLite / FTS5 / sqlite-vec |
| **Testing** | Vitest |
| **Feature Flags** | `SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER`, `SPECKIT_RSF_FUSION`, `SPECKIT_CHANNEL_MIN_REP` |

### Overview

Implement a query complexity router that classifies queries into 3 tiers (simple/moderate/complex) and routes to appropriate channel subsets for latency optimization. Evaluate Relative Score Fusion as an alternative to RRF across all 3 fusion variants with shadow comparison on 100+ queries. Enforce channel min-representation post-fusion to guarantee retrieval diversity.

### Architecture

Query classifier --> tier routing --> channel subset selection --> fusion (RRF or RSF) --> R2 enforcement

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Pipeline extension — classifier stage prepended to existing pipeline; RSF runs as shadow alongside RRF; R2 appended post-fusion.

### Key Components
- **Query Classifier**: Classifies queries into simple/moderate/complex based on query features (length, term count, trigger phrase presence)
- **Tier Router**: Maps classification to channel subset (simple=2 channels, moderate=3-4, complex=5)
- **RSF Engine**: All 3 fusion variants (single-pair, multi-list, cross-variant) running in shadow mode
- **R2 Enforcer**: Post-fusion min-representation with quality floor 0.2, only for channels that returned results

### Data Flow
1. Query enters classifier --> tier assigned
2. Tier router selects channel subset (min 2 channels)
3. Selected channels execute in parallel
4. RRF fuses results (RSF runs shadow)
5. R2 enforcer checks channel representation in top-k
6. Results returned with classification metadata

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: R15 Query Complexity Router (8-14h)

#### Phase 1a: Classifier Design (2-4h)
- [ ] Design classifier features (query length, term count, trigger presence, semantic complexity)
- [ ] Define classification boundaries (simple: ≤3 terms OR trigger, complex: >8 terms AND no trigger)
- [ ] Implement 3-tier classification logic with config-driven thresholds

#### Phase 1b: Tier Routing + Flag Wiring (3-4h)
- [ ] Implement tier-to-channel-subset mapping (config-driven)
- [ ] Enforce minimum 2 channels for all tiers
- [ ] Add feature flag `SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER`

#### Phase 1c: Pipeline Integration (2-4h)
- [ ] Wire classifier+router into pipeline entry point
- [ ] Enable simultaneous full-pipeline and routed-pipeline execution

#### Phase 1d: Shadow Run + Verification (1-2h)
- [ ] Shadow-run both pipelines, compare results
- [ ] Verify p95 <30ms for simple queries

### Phase 2: R14/N1 Relative Score Fusion (10-14h)

#### Phase 2a: Single-Pair RSF (4-5h)
- [ ] Implement RSF single-pair variant (foundation)
- [ ] Add feature flag `SPECKIT_RSF_FUSION`
- [ ] Verify output clamped to [0,1]

#### Phase 2b: Multi-List RSF (3-5h)
- [ ] Implement RSF multi-list variant
- [ ] Verify consistency with single-pair on 2-list input

#### Phase 2c: Cross-Variant RSF (3-4h)
- [ ] Implement RSF cross-variant variant
- [ ] Shadow mode: RSF runs alongside RRF, results logged but not used

### Phase 3: R2 Channel Min-Representation (6-10h)
- [ ] Implement post-fusion channel representation check
- [ ] Add quality floor (0.2 threshold)
- [ ] Only enforce for channels that returned results
- [ ] Add feature flag `SPECKIT_CHANNEL_MIN_REP`
- [ ] Verify top-3 precision within 5% of baseline

### Phase 4: Shadow Comparison + Verification
- [ ] Run RSF vs RRF shadow comparison on 100+ queries
- [ ] Compute Kendall tau correlation
- [ ] Document RSF decision (tau <0.4 = reject RSF)
- [ ] Run off-ramp evaluation (MRR@5, constitutional, cold-start)
- [ ] Sprint 3 exit gate verification
- [ ] **Evaluate hard scope cap**: Record Sprint 0-3 actual metric values and effort actuals. If off-ramp thresholds met, document STOP decision. If continuing, document with (a) measured deficiencies, (b) updated effort estimates, (c) ROI assessment.

> **HARD SCOPE CAP — Sprint 2+3 Off-Ramp**: Sprints 4-7 require NEW spec approval based on demonstrated need from Sprint 0-3 metrics. Approval must include: (a) evidence remaining work addresses measured deficiencies, (b) updated effort estimates based on Sprint 0-3 actuals, (c) ROI assessment. Default decision after Sprint 3 is STOP unless thresholds are NOT met.

### Pre-Implementation: Eval Corpus Sourcing Strategy

The 100+ queries required for RSF shadow comparison (CHK-030) must be sourced using a stratified approach:

1. **Manual curation** (minimum 20 queries): Draw from Sprint 0 ground truth corpus. Ensure coverage across all 3 complexity tiers (simple/moderate/complex) with ≥5 queries per tier.
2. **Synthetic expansion** (60-80 queries): Generate from trigger phrases and memory content, but explicitly exclude trigger-phrase-based queries from the simple-tier count to avoid inflating easy-case representation.
3. **Tier distribution documentation**: Record the final tier distribution before running the comparison. Flag any tier with <15% representation.

**Known limitation**: Synthetic queries at <500 memories corpus may produce tau scores that reflect generation bias. Acknowledge this limitation in the RSF decision documentation.

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Sprint 2 exit gate | Internal | Yellow | Cannot begin — scoring calibration must be verified |
| Eval infrastructure (R13-S1) | Internal | Green | Required for shadow comparison metrics |
| Feature flag system | Internal | Green | Required for all 3 flags |

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: R15 misclassification causes >5% recall degradation; RSF diverges significantly from RRF; R2 degrades precision >5%
- **Procedure**: Disable 3 flags together (R15+R2+R14/N1 interact); verify independent rollback behavior

## L2: EFFORT ESTIMATION

| Phase | Complexity | Estimated Effort |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Phase 1: R15 Router (T001a-d) | Medium | 8-14h |
| Phase 2: R14/N1 RSF (T002a-c) | Medium | 10-14h |
| Phase 3: R2 Min-Rep (T003a-c) | Low-Medium | 6-10h |
| Phase 3b: Query Optimization (T006, T007) | Low-Medium | 8-13h |
| Phase 4: Shadow + Verify (T004, T005) | Low | included |
| PI-B3: Spec Folder Discovery (T009) [P2] | Low | 4-8h |
| **Total (P1 core)** | | **32-51h** |
| **Total (incl. P2 PI-B3)** | | **36-59h** |

> **Effort reconciliation note**: Parent plan (../plan.md) lists Sprint 3 core at 34-53h. This child plan's authoritative task-level sum is 32-51h (P1 core). The difference arises because the parent plan's R15 line (10-16h) includes buffer for classifier iteration, while this child plan's Phase 1 breakdown (8-14h) reflects specific subtask estimates. Phase 3b (T006, T007) was added during child plan decomposition for REQ-S3-004 and REQ-S3-005.

## PageIndex Tasks

### PI-A2: Search Strategy Degradation with Fallback Chain [DEFERRED]

> **Deferred from Sprint 3.** Re-evaluate after Sprint 3 using measured frequency of low-result/low-similarity queries. See UT review R1.

- ~~Implement similarity and result-count threshold checks after channel execution (threshold: top result similarity < 0.4 OR result count < 3)~~
- ~~Implement Tier 2 broadened search: relaxed filters, trigger matching, loosened channel constraints~~
- ~~Implement Tier 3 structural search: folder browsing, tier-based listing, no vector requirement~~
- ~~Wire three-tier chain into the R15 routing layer — fallback is automatic and bounded~~
- ~~Preserve R15 minimum-2-channel constraint at all fallback levels~~
- ~~Verify fallback triggers correctly on low-similarity and low-count results~~
- **Effort**: 12-16h | **Risk**: Medium | **Dependency**: Sprint 0 eval framework

### PI-B3: Description-Based Spec Folder Discovery (4-8h) [P2/Optional]
- [ ] Generate 1-sentence description per spec folder from `spec.md` content
- [ ] Write descriptions to `descriptions.json` cache file (path: project root or spec root)
- [ ] Integrate cache lookup into `memory_context` orchestration layer for folder routing
- [ ] Add cache invalidation / regeneration trigger when `spec.md` changes
- [ ] Verify folder routing uses descriptions before issuing vector queries
- **Effort**: 4-8h | **Risk**: Low

<!-- ANCHOR:enhanced-rollback -->
## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Sprint 2 exit gate verified
- [ ] All 3 feature flags configured and defaulting to OFF
- [ ] Eval infrastructure operational for shadow comparison

### Rollback Procedure
1. Disable all 3 flags: `SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER`, `SPECKIT_RSF_FUSION`, `SPECKIT_CHANNEL_MIN_REP`
2. Verify full 5-channel pipeline resumes for all queries
3. Verify independent flag rollback (3-5h testing)
4. Check eval metrics for regression confirmation

### Rollback Risk: MEDIUM
- R15+R2+R14/N1 interact — must verify each flag can be independently disabled
- Independent rollback testing estimated at 3-5h

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No
- **Reversal procedure**: N/A — no schema changes in Sprint 3
