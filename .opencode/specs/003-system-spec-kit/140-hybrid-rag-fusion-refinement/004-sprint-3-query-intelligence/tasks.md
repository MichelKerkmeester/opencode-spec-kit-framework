<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: R15 Query Complexity Router

### R15 Subtask Decomposition

- [x] T001a [P] Define classifier boundaries and feature design — query length (chars), term count (whitespace-split), trigger phrase presence (exact match), semantic complexity heuristic (stop-word ratio). Classification boundaries: simple (≤3 terms OR trigger match), complex (>8 terms AND no trigger), moderate (interior). Config-driven thresholds. [2-4h] — R15
  - **Acceptance**: Classifier correctly assigns 10+ test queries per tier

- [x] T001b Implement tier-to-channel-subset routing and flag wiring — map classification tiers to channel subsets (simple=2, moderate=3-4, complex=5), enforce minimum 2 channels, add `SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER` flag [3-4h] {T001a} — R15
  - **Acceptance**: Routing table is config-driven, not hardcoded; min-2-channel invariant holds

- [x] T001c Integrate classifier into pipeline entry point — wire classifier+router into the existing pipeline, ensure both full pipeline and routed pipeline can run simultaneously [2-4h] {T001b} — R15
  - **Acceptance**: Pipeline accepts classifier output and routes to correct channel subset

- [x] T001d Shadow comparison run and p95 latency verification — run both full pipeline and routed pipeline simultaneously, compare results, verify p95 <30ms for simple queries [1-2h] {T001c} — R15
  - **Acceptance**: Shadow-run confirms no recall degradation; p95 <30ms verified

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: R14/N1 Relative Score Fusion

- [x] T002a [P] Implement RSF single-pair variant — foundation implementation of Relative Score Fusion for a single pair of ranked lists, behind `SPECKIT_RSF_FUSION` flag [4-5h] — R14/N1
  - **Acceptance**: Single-pair RSF produces valid fused ranking; output clamped to [0,1]

- [x] T002b Implement RSF multi-list variant — extend RSF to handle multiple ranked lists simultaneously [3-5h] {T002a} — R14/N1
  - **Acceptance**: Multi-list variant produces consistent results with single-pair on 2-list input

- [x] T002c Implement RSF cross-variant variant — cross-variant RSF for comparing results across different fusion strategies [3-4h] {T002b} — R14/N1
  - **Acceptance**: Cross-variant RSF runs in shadow mode alongside RRF; results logged
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: R2 Channel Min-Representation

- [x] T003a [P] Implement post-fusion channel representation check — scan top-k results for channel diversity, identify under-represented channels that returned results [2-4h] {T001d} — R2
  - **Acceptance**: Representation check correctly identifies channels with <1 result in top-k

- [x] T003b Implement quality floor enforcement and flag wiring — promote under-represented channel results only if score >= 0.2, add `SPECKIT_CHANNEL_MIN_REP` flag, skip enforcement for channels that returned no results [2-4h] {T003a} — R2
  - **Acceptance**: Quality floor prevents low-quality promotion; flag gates all R2 behavior; empty channels excluded

- [x] T003c Verify R2 precision impact — measure top-3 precision with R2 enabled vs baseline, confirm within 5% [2-3h] {T003b} — R2
  - **Acceptance**: Top-3 precision within 5% of baseline; regression test added
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3b -->
## Phase 3b: Query Optimization

- [x] T006 Implement confidence-based result truncation — adaptive top-K cutoff based on score confidence gap between consecutive results [5-8h] {T001d} — R15 extension
  - Score gap threshold: if gap between rank N and N+1 exceeds 2x median gap, truncate at N
  - Must respect minimum result count (3) regardless of confidence
- [x] T007 [P] Implement dynamic token budget allocation — adjust returned context size by query complexity tier [3-5h] {T001d} — R15 extension (FUT-7)
  - Simple: 1500 tokens | Moderate: 2500 tokens | Complex: 4000 tokens
  - Budget applies to total returned content, not per-result

<!-- ANCHOR:pageindex -->
## PageIndex Tasks

- [ ] ~~T008~~ **DEFERRED** — PI-A2 search strategy degradation fallback chain deferred from Sprint 3. Will be re-evaluated after Sprint 3 using measured frequency of low-result (<3) and low-similarity (<0.4) query outcomes from Sprint 0-3 data. See UT review R1.
- [x] T009 [P] [P2] Implement PI-B3 description-based spec folder discovery — generate 1-sentence descriptions from spec.md per folder, cache in descriptions.json, integrate lookup into memory_context orchestration layer before vector queries [4-8h] — PI-B3
<!-- /ANCHOR:pageindex -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-4 -->
## Phase 4: Shadow Comparison + Verification

- [x] T004 Run shadow comparison: RSF vs RRF on 100+ queries, compute Kendall tau [included] {T002c}
- [x] T-IP-S3 [P0] **Interaction pair test: R15+R2** — verify R15 minimum = 2 channels even for "simple" tier; R2 channel-minimum representation not violated by R15 routing [1-2h] {T001d, T003c} — CHK-037
- [x] T-FS3 Feature flag sunset review at Sprint 3 exit — review all active feature flags; permanently enable flags with positive metrics, remove flags with negative metrics, extend measurement window (max 14 days) for inconclusive flags; ensure ≤6 simultaneous active flags [0.5-1h] {T004} — NFR-O01/O02/O03
- [x] T005 [GATE] Sprint 3 exit gate + off-ramp evaluation [0h] {T001d, T002c, T003c, T004, T006, T007, T-FS3}
