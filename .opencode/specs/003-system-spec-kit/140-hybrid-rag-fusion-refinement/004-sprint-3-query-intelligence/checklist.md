## Sprint 3 Specific Verification

### R15 — Query Complexity Router
- [x] CHK-S3-020 [P1] R15 p95 latency for simple queries <30ms (conditional: simulated only — 20ms measured in simulation)
- [x] CHK-S3-021 [P0] R15 minimum 2 channels even for simple queries (R2 compatibility)
- [x] CHK-S3-022 [P1] R15 classification accuracy tested with 10+ queries per tier
- [x] CHK-S3-023 [P1] R15 moderate-tier routing verified (3-4 channels selected)
- [x] CHK-S3-024 [P1] R15 classifier fallback to "complex" on failure verified
- [x] CHK-S3-025 [P1] R15+R2 interaction test: R15 minimum 2 channels preserves R2 channel diversity guarantee

### R14/N1 — Relative Score Fusion
- [x] CHK-S3-030 [P1] R14/N1 shadow comparison: minimum 100 queries executed
- [x] CHK-S3-031 [P1] Kendall tau computed between RSF and RRF rankings
- [x] CHK-S3-032 [P1] RSF decision documented (tau <0.4 = reject RSF)
- [x] CHK-S3-033 [P1] All 3 fusion variants tested (single-pair, multi-list, cross-variant)
- [x] CHK-S3-034 [P1] **Eval corpus sourcing strategy defined**: 100+ query corpus sourced with stratified tier distribution documented. Minimum 20 manually curated queries, synthetic query limitations acknowledged.
- [x] CHK-S3-035 [P1] RSF numerical stability: output clamped to [0,1], no overflow on extreme inputs

### R2 — Channel Min-Representation
- [x] CHK-S3-040 [P1] R2 dark-run: top-3 precision within 5% of baseline (conditional: unit tests only — live precision not measured)
- [x] CHK-S3-041 [P1] R2 only enforces for channels that returned results
- [x] CHK-S3-042 [P1] R2 quality floor 0.2 verified (below-threshold results not promoted)

### REQ-S3-004 — Confidence-Based Result Truncation
- [x] CHK-S3-043 [P1] Score confidence gap detection: truncation triggers when gap between rank N and N+1 exceeds 2x median gap
- [x] CHK-S3-044 [P1] Minimum 3 results guaranteed regardless of confidence gap
- [x] CHK-S3-045 [P1] Irrelevant tail results reduced by >30% vs untruncated baseline

### REQ-S3-005 — Dynamic Token Budget Allocation
- [x] CHK-S3-046 [P1] Simple-tier queries allocated 1500 tokens
- [x] CHK-S3-047 [P1] Moderate-tier queries allocated 2500 tokens
- [x] CHK-S3-048 [P1] Complex-tier queries allocated 4000 tokens
- [x] CHK-S3-049 [P1] Token budget applies to total returned content, not per-result

### Cross-Cutting
- [x] CHK-S3-027 [P1] Independent flag rollback testing: each of 5 flags (COMPLEXITY_ROUTER, RSF_FUSION, CHANNEL_MIN_REP, CONFIDENCE_TRUNCATION, DYNAMIC_TOKEN_BUDGET) can be independently disabled without breaking other features

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-S3-050 [P0] All acceptance criteria met (REQ-S3-001 through REQ-S3-005)
- [x] CHK-S3-051 [P1] 22-28 new tests passing (600-900 LOC)
- [x] CHK-S3-052 [P1] Edge cases tested (empty channels, all-empty, classifier failure)
- [x] CHK-S3-053 [P1] Existing 158+ tests still pass

## PageIndex Verification

### PI-A2 — Search Strategy Degradation with Fallback Chain [DEFERRED]
> **Deferred from Sprint 3.** PI-A2 will be re-evaluated after Sprint 3 using measured frequency of low-result (<3) and low-similarity (<0.4) query outcomes from Sprint 0-3 data. Effort (12-16h) is disproportionate to unmeasured need at current corpus scale (<500 memories). See UT review R1.

### PI-B3 — Description-Based Spec Folder Discovery [P2/Optional]
- [ ] CHK-PI-B3-001 [P2] descriptions.json generated with one sentence per spec folder derived from spec.md
- [ ] CHK-PI-B3-002 [P2] memory_context orchestration layer performs folder lookup via descriptions.json before issuing vector queries
- [ ] CHK-PI-B3-003 [P2] Cache invalidation triggers when spec.md changes for a given folder
- [ ] CHK-PI-B3-004 [P2] descriptions.json absent = graceful degradation to full-corpus search (no error)

<!-- ANCHOR:off-ramp -->
## Off-Ramp Evaluation

- [x] CHK-S3-060 [P1] Off-ramp evaluated: MRR@5 >= 0.7
- [x] CHK-S3-061 [P1] Off-ramp evaluated: constitutional accuracy >= 95%
- [x] CHK-S3-062 [P1] Off-ramp evaluated: cold-start recall >= 90%
- [x] CHK-S3-063 [P1] Off-ramp decision documented (continue or stop)
- [x] CHK-S3-064 [P1] **Sprint 2+3 hard scope cap**: If off-ramp thresholds met, Sprint 4-7 require NEW spec approval. Decision documented with metric evidence from Sprint 0-3 actuals. **PI-A2 deferred:** Re-evaluate using Sprint 0-3 frequency data on low-result queries.

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-S3-070 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized
- [x] CHK-S3-071 [P1] Code comments adequate
- [x] CHK-S3-072 [P1] Feature flags documented

## Feature Flag Audit

- [x] CHK-S3-073 [P1] **Feature flag count**: Active feature flag count at Sprint 3 exit is ≤6. Evidence: 5 active flags — `SPECKIT_COMPLEXITY_ROUTER`, `SPECKIT_RSF_FUSION`, `SPECKIT_CHANNEL_MIN_REP`, `SPECKIT_CONFIDENCE_TRUNCATION`, `SPECKIT_DYNAMIC_TOKEN_BUDGET` (5/6 limit)
- [x] CHK-S3-074 [P1] **Flag sunset decisions documented**: Any flag retired or consolidated has metric evidence supporting the decision recorded.
- [ ] CHK-S3-075 [P2] **R12 mutual exclusion**: R12 (query expansion) flag is inactive at Sprint 3 exit gate. R12 is Sprint 5 scope; confirming it is not active prevents R12+R15 interaction.
