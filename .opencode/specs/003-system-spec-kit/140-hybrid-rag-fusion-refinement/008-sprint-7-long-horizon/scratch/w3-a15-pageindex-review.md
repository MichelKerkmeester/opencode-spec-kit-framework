## 2. PI-A5 Applicability Assessment: Verify-Fix-Verify and the R13-S3 Reporting Loop

### What PI-A5 is

PI-A5 is the **verify-fix-verify memory quality loop**, originally identified in the PageIndex quality assurance architecture (§3 of RESEARCH-140-010). The pattern follows a three-phase bounded correction cycle:

```
Phase 1: VERIFY — Check quality of extracted/saved artifact
    ↓ (if quality < threshold)
Phase 2: FIX — Apply bounded corrections to failing elements
    ↓
Phase 3: RE-VERIFY — Check whether corrections improved quality
    ↓ (if still failing AND retries < limit)
    → Return to Phase 2
    ↓ (if quality >= threshold OR retries exhausted)
Phase 4: FALLBACK — Degrade to simpler mode or flag for manual review
```

### Implementation status (prior sprints)

PI-A5 was **implemented in Sprint 1** (002-sprint-1-graph-signal-activation), not Sprint 0. It was deferred from Sprint 0 per Ultra-Think Review REC-09 and completed as T008 in Sprint 1:

- **Requirement**: REQ-057 (PI-A5)
- **Checklist item**: `[x] PI-A5 [P1]: Verify-fix-verify memory quality loop operational — quality score computed post-save; auto-fix triggered if <0.6; rejection after 2 retries logged with spec folder and rejection reason`
- **Modified file**: `memory-save.ts` — post-save quality scoring, auto-fix loop, rejection logging
- **Parameters implemented**: quality threshold 0.6, max retries 2 (not 3, because memory saves are less critical than document indexing per RESEARCH-140-011, A5)

PI-A5 is therefore a **completed infrastructure component** as of Sprint 1, not a Sprint 7 deliverable. Sprint 7's reference to PI-A5 is a forward-application question: how should R13-S3 leverage this existing infrastructure?

### Applicability to R13-S3 (Full Reporting + Ablation Framework)

R13-S3 (T004 in Sprint 7 tasks) implements:
1. A full reporting dashboard with per-sprint and per-channel metric views
2. An ablation study framework that enables/disables individual channels and measures Recall@20 delta per component

**Direct integration point**: The quality metrics logged by PI-A5 (post-save quality scores, auto-fix events, rejection events with spec folder and reason) feed directly into the R13-S3 reporting dashboard. Specifically:

- **Quality trend reporting**: PI-A5 rejection events and auto-fix rates should be surfaced as a time-series view in the R13-S3 dashboard, showing memory quality health over the accumulation lifecycle. At long-horizon scale (>5K memories), quality drift becomes detectable through aggregate rejection rate changes.
- **Ablation attribution**: The R13-S3 ablation framework can isolate PI-A5's contribution to retrieval quality by comparing precision/recall metrics in cohorts where auto-fix was triggered versus cohorts where memories passed initial verification. This attribution is only possible if T004 is designed to consume the PI-A5 quality log.
- **V-F-V for the reporting loop itself**: The PageIndex pattern also suggests applying verify-fix-verify to the R13-S3 output: after generating an ablation report, verify that the Recall@20 deltas are statistically coherent (e.g., not artifacts of small sample size), attempt correction if anomalies are detected, and re-verify. This bounded self-check prevents reporting false conclusions under low-data conditions.

**Specific integration action for T004**: When implementing the R13-S3 ablation framework, include a panel that surfaces PI-A5 quality events (auto-fix rate, rejection rate, quality score distribution over time). This requires that T004 reads from the quality metric log that PI-A5 writes to the eval infrastructure.

**Risk**: PI-A5 quality metrics must already be persisted to the eval infrastructure (as specified in Sprint 1 T008). If the Sprint 1 implementation logged quality events in-memory only and did not persist them, T004 will have no data to surface. **Verification needed before T004 implementation**: confirm that PI-A5 quality events are written to a queryable store (e.g., a `quality_events` table or eval log).

## 3. PI-B1 Applicability Assessment: Tree Thinning and Sprint 7 Deliverables

### What PI-B1 is

PI-B1 is **tree thinning for spec folder consolidation**, derived from PageIndex's `tree_thinning_for_index()` algorithm (§2.2 of RESEARCH-140-010). The algorithm merges small nodes into their parents bottom-up:

- Traverse tree bottom-up (leaves first)
- For each leaf < threshold tokens: merge content into parent
- Remove merged node; recalculate parent token count
- Repeat until stable

**Thresholds for memory system** (from RESEARCH-140-011, B1):
- Files < 300 tokens: merge summary into parent section
- Files < 100 tokens: use file text directly as summary (no LLM call)

### Implementation status (prior sprints)

PI-B1 was **implemented in Sprint 5** (006-sprint-5-pipeline-refactor), completed as T011:

- **File created**: `scripts/core/tree-thinning.ts` (~250 LOC) — bottom-up merge logic for token reduction
- **Integration**: Wired into `scripts/core/workflow.ts` — PI-B1 tree thinning applied to effective rendered file list (merged entries collapsed with parent merge notes)
- **Scope**: Pre-pipeline optimization operating on the context loading layer, before Stage 1 candidate generation
- **Implementation summary**: "Sprint 5 implements the 4-stage retrieval pipeline refactor (R6), search enhancements (R9, R12), spec-kit retrieval metadata (S2, S3), dual-scope auto-surface hooks (TM-05), and three PageIndex improvements (PI-B1, PI-B2, PI-A4)."

PI-B1 is therefore a **completed infrastructure component** as of Sprint 5.

### Relevance reduction due to R8 being skipped

The Sprint 7 spec notes that R8 (memory summary generation) is gated on >5K active memories with embeddings. Since R8 is the primary feature in Sprint 7 where tree thinning would have applied (summary pre-filtering of a large accumulated memory tree requires precisely the kind of pruning PI-B1 provides), and since R8 is skipped at typical spec-kit deployment scale (<2K memories):

**PI-B1's direct applicability to Sprint 7 is reduced.** The pre-pipeline thinning already deployed in Sprint 5 handles the current scale adequately. There is no new tree thinning work needed in Sprint 7 simply because R8 is not being implemented.

### Residual applicability to R13-S3 ablation traversal

One remaining Sprint 7 context where PI-B1 is relevant is the **R13-S3 ablation framework's traversal of spec folder history**. The ablation framework must compare metrics across many sprint phases and evaluation cycles, which can produce a large accumulated data tree. If the ablation traversal naively loads all historical records, it risks:

- Token budget overrun in any LLM-assisted analysis steps
- Memory pressure from large data joins across sprint-separated eval runs

**Integration point**: When T004 implements the ablation study framework, the data loading path should apply PI-B1-style thinning: group small eval records (individual single-query results with <200 tokens of data) into their parent sprint-level summaries before running ablation analysis. This is a direct application of the existing `tree-thinning.ts` logic to eval data rather than spec folder files.

**Implementation guidance**: The `generate-context.js` workflow already calls the tree-thinning module for spec folder context loading. T004 can reuse this module by passing ablation data entries as if they were spec folder files — the module's token threshold logic is data-format-agnostic when input conforms to the expected structure (title, content, token_count fields).

**Risk**: Low. Tree thinning is already implemented and tested. The reuse risk is that ablation data entries may not conform to the tree-thinning module's expected input format; a thin adapter layer would be needed.

## 4. Recommendations: Specific Integration Actions

### Action 1 — R13-S3 (T004): Surface PI-A5 quality metrics in dashboard [Low effort, High value]

Before implementing T004, verify PI-A5 quality events are persisted (not just logged in-memory). If persisted, include a quality health panel in the R13-S3 dashboard that shows:
- Auto-fix rate over time (weekly/monthly rollup)
- Rejection rate and top rejection reasons by spec folder
- Quality score distribution across the memory corpus

This converts PI-A5's operational quality loop into a long-horizon monitoring signal, directly serving the spec 7 goal of "long-horizon quality monitoring."

### Action 2 — R13-S3 (T004): Apply V-F-V self-check to ablation report generation [Low effort, Medium value]

After generating each ablation report, apply a PI-A5-inspired verification step:
1. Verify: Check that Recall@20 deltas are within plausible bounds (e.g., not a 40% single-channel swing on <50 queries)
2. Fix: If anomalous, flag the specific channel-query combination for manual review rather than propagating the anomaly
3. Re-verify: Confirm the flagged entries are excluded from the aggregate ablation summary

This prevents the ablation framework from producing misleading conclusions under low-data conditions, which is the long-horizon scenario where Sprint 7 operates.

### Action 3 — R13-S3 (T004): Reuse tree-thinning.ts for ablation data loading [Medium effort, Low-Medium value]

If the ablation framework accumulates large historical eval records across Sprints 0-7, apply the existing PI-B1 tree-thinning module to collapse small per-query records into sprint-level summaries before ablation analysis. This is only necessary if total ablation data exceeds ~50K tokens — verify at implementation time.

### Action 4 — R8 (T001): If scale gate is met, integrate PI-B1 before summary generation [Only if R8 activates]

If the scale gate check (active memories with embeddings) returns >5K at T001 start, apply PI-B1 tree thinning as a pre-processing step before memory summary generation. This reduces the summary generation workload by collapsing low-information memories into their parent clusters before the summary LLM call. The `tree-thinning.ts` module from Sprint 5 is directly reusable for this purpose.

## 5. Summary Table

| Pattern | Home Sprint | Implementation Status | Sprint 7 Application | Required Action |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| PI-A5 (Verify-fix-verify) | Sprint 1 (deferred from 0) | Complete — `memory-save.ts` operational | R13-S3 quality reporting; V-F-V self-check on ablation reports | Verify PI-A5 events are persisted; wire into T004 dashboard |
| PI-B1 (Tree thinning) | Sprint 5 | Complete — `scripts/core/tree-thinning.ts` operational | Reduced relevance (R8 skipped); residual use in ablation data loading | Reuse module in T004 if ablation data is large; no new tree thinning work needed |

**Bottom line**: Neither PI-A5 nor PI-B1 requires new implementation in Sprint 7. Both are existing infrastructure. Sprint 7's task is to **consume** these patterns in the R13-S3 deliverables — PI-A5 quality events as reporting data, PI-B1 thinning as a data loading optimization if ablation history is large. Both integrations are optional enhancements, not blocking requirements for the Sprint 7 exit gate.
