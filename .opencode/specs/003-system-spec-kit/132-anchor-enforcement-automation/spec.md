# Feature Specification: Anchor Enforcement Automation

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This specification addresses systematic gaps in template and anchor compliance within the system-spec-kit framework, implementing automated enforcement to prevent spec documentation from being created without full template alignment and proper ANCHOR tag structure.

**Key Decisions**: Implement pre-flight validation gates, automate ANCHOR tag generation, enhance speckit agent routing compliance

**Critical Dependencies**: MCP Memory Server validation hooks, speckit agent dispatch protocol, template composition system

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Spec folder documentation can currently be created without full template compliance or proper ANCHOR tag structure. The @speckit agent, designed as the exclusive authority for spec documentation, is underutilized due to weak enforcement of routing rules. This allows documentation to be created manually or through alternative agents, resulting in inconsistent structure, missing ANCHOR tags, and incomplete validation.

### Purpose
Implement automated enforcement mechanisms that make template/anchor non-compliance impossible, ensuring 100% spec documentation flows through @speckit with validated templates and proper ANCHOR tag structure.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Pre-flight validation gates for spec file creation
- Automated ANCHOR tag generation and validation
- Enhanced routing enforcement for @speckit agent
- Template compliance checking in validate.sh
- Root cause analysis of under-utilization patterns
- Prevention strategy implementation

### Out of Scope
- Retroactive fixes to existing non-compliant specs (separate migration effort)
- Changes to ANCHOR tag format specification (established in spec 129)
- Template content redesign (only enforcement of existing templates)
- Non-spec documentation enforcement (focuses only on spec folders)

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | MCP Server Hook Integration | Cannot validate at write-time | Validate at dispatch-time + read-time fallback |
| Risk | Breaking Existing Workflows | Users frustrated by new validation | Clear error messages with remediation guidance |
| Risk | Performance Overhead | Validation adds latency to spec creation | Cache template hashes, optimize ANCHOR parsing |
| Dependency | Agent Dispatch Protocol | Must modify orchestrator routing logic | Test with multiple agent scenarios |
| Risk | Incomplete ANCHOR Coverage | Some sections might not need anchors | Define clear criteria for ANCHOR requirements |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Template validation must complete within 200ms per file
- **NFR-P02**: ANCHOR parsing overhead <50ms for typical memory file

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Validation scripts must not execute arbitrary code from spec files
- **NFR-S02**: Template hash verification uses cryptographic hash (SHA-256 minimum)

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Validation failures must never block legitimate spec creation (false positive rate <1%)
- **NFR-R02**: ANCHOR generator must produce valid tags 100% of the time
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty spec file: Validation catches missing required sections
- Spec with no memory/: ANCHOR validation skips memory checks, validates spec docs only
- Partial template use: validate.sh detects missing required sections per level

### Error Scenarios
- Template file not found: Validation logs warning, continues with structure checks only
- Corrupted ANCHOR tags: check-anchors.sh reports line number and mismatch details
- Agent dispatch failure: Orchestrator logs error, retries with @speckit, escalates to user if persistent
- Concurrent spec creation: File system locks prevent race conditions on template reads

<!-- ANCHOR:user-stories -->
## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Automatic ANCHOR Tag Generation (Priority: P0)

**As a** spec documentation author, **I want** ANCHOR tags automatically added to all major sections, **so that** I don't have to manually wrap every section and risk missing tags.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a spec file created from template, When I fill in sections, Then all major sections have proper `<!-- ANCHOR:id -->` and `<!-- /ANCHOR:id -->` tags
2. Given manual section edits, When ANCHOR tags already exist, Then auto-generation preserves existing tags
3. Given a new section added, When section matches naming convention, Then ANCHOR tags generated automatically

### US-002: Pre-flight Validation Gate (Priority: P0)

**As a** system enforcing spec quality, **I want** validation to run before any spec file is written, **so that** non-compliant documentation never enters the codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a spec file creation attempt, When file content missing required sections, Then write is blocked with clear error message
2. Given a spec file with mismatched ANCHOR tags, When validation runs, Then user sees line number and fix guidance
3. Given validation failure, When user corrects issues, Then retry succeeds immediately

### US-003: Speckit Routing Enforcement (Priority: P0)

**As a** orchestrator managing agent dispatch, **I want** spec file writes to ONLY go through @speckit, **so that** template compliance is guaranteed by design.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a request to create spec documentation, When orchestrator evaluates routing, Then @speckit is the ONLY option dispatched
2. Given @general or @write attempting spec file write, When file path is in spec folder, Then write is rejected with routing violation error
3. Given emergency bypass scenario, When user explicitly overrides, Then bypass is logged for audit trail

## 16. OPEN QUESTIONS

- Should validation be opt-out (SPECKIT_SKIP_VALIDATION=true) or always enforced?
- What constitutes valid reason for emergency bypass of @speckit routing?
- Should ANCHOR tags be required for ALL sections or only major sections (## headings)?
