<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**What Was Built**:

- **Completed a strict-mode hardening pass for the system-spec-kit validation pipeline to align with...** - Completed a strict-mode hardening pass for the system-spec-kit validation pipeline to align with sk-code--opencode expectations.

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Several validation rule scripts used non-strict shell mode and array patterns that were unsafe under nounset, causing runtime failures when strict execution was enforced.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-ai-protocols.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-anchors.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-complexity.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-evidence.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/rules/check-files.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-folder-naming.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-frontmatter.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/.../rules/check-level-match.sh` - Script

**How to Extend**:

- Apply validation patterns to new input handling

- Maintain consistent error handling approach

**Common Patterns**:

- **Validation**: Input validation before processing

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Filter Pipeline**: Chain filters for data transformation

### FEATURE: Completed a strict-mode hardening pass for the system-spec-kit validation pipeline to align with...

Completed a strict-mode hardening pass for the system-spec-kit validation pipeline to align with sk-code--opencode expectations. Standardized remaining rule scripts to set -euo pipefail, fixed nounset-sensitive array handling that caused unbound variable failures, and validated end-to-end execution for validate.sh, test-validation.sh, and upgrade-level.sh (including bash -u runs). Confirmed no regressions with the Level 3+ target spec and full validation test suite.

<!-- /ANCHOR:architecture-completed-strictmode-hardening-pass-87b666a0 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation-technical-implementation-details-8eb50f9d -->
### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Several validation rule scripts used non-strict shell mode and array patterns that were unsafe under nounset, causing runtime failures when strict execution was enforced.; solution: Migrated remaining rule scripts to strict mode and refactored array iteration/merge logic to avoid unbound variable errors while preserving existing validation behavior.; patterns: Use set -euo pipefail for shell scripts, guard optional arrays before expansion, and verify with both normal and bash -u execution paths plus regression test suite.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/132-anchor-enforcement-automation` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/132-anchor-enforcement-automation" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/132-anchor-enforcement-automation", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/132-anchor-enforcement-automation/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/132-anchor-enforcement-automation --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
