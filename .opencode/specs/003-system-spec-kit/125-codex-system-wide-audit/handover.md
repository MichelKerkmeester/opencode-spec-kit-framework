# Session Handover Document

Session handover after runtime remediation and verification closure.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: handover | v1.0 (refactored) -->

---

## 1. Handover Summary

- **From Session:** 2026-02-16 runtime remediation + closure verification
- **To Session:** Follow-up maintenance (optional warning cleanup)
- **Current State:** Remediation scope complete; checklist/tasks closed with evidence
- **Continuation Attempt:** 2

---

## 2. What Is Done

Completed in this session:
- Shell runtime remediation in `upgrade-level.sh`, `validate.sh`, `check-level-match.sh`, and registry/test files.
- MCP runtime remediation in `memory-indexer.ts`, `session-manager.ts`, `memory-save.ts`, and `memory-index.ts`.
- Added targeted MCP test coverage and reran shell/MCP/spec validation checks.
- Fixed validator rule counting bug (`0\n0`) and tuned complexity heuristics to match current spec template patterns.
- Updated spec 125 closure docs (`tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`, `handover.md`) and evidence files.

Not done:
- Warning-only quality debt in specs 121/124/125 remains out of this remediation scope.

## 3. Remaining Backlog

### Optional follow-up (warning cleanup)
1. Address `SECTION_COUNTS`/recommended-section warnings in `121-script-audit-comprehensive` and `124-upgrade-level-script`.

## 4. Verification Commands (Path-Correct)

From `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts`:

```bash
bash -n spec/upgrade-level.sh && bash -n spec/validate.sh && bash -n rules/check-level-match.sh
bash tests/test-upgrade-level.sh
bash tests/test-validation.sh
bash registry-loader.sh upgrade-level --json
bash spec/validate.sh "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/AI Systems/Barter/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive"

npx tsc --build
node tests/test-subfolder-resolution.js
```

From `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server`:

```

## 5. Critical Notes for Next Session

- Checklist and tasks are now fully closed for this remediation scope.
- Evidence references are captured in `checklist.md` and `scratch/verification-evidence.md`.
- Validation warnings shown in 121/124 are known and currently non-blocking.

---

## CONTINUATION PROMPT

Use this to continue optional maintenance work:

```text
Create a follow-up spec to clear warning-only debt from specs 121/124/125 without regressing runtime fixes completed in spec 125.
```
