<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->
### Context

Specs 014-016 (agent system) and 122-129 (spec-kit system) have been implemented across 200+ files, but their documentation artifacts (READMEs, SKILL.md, command configs, agent configs, changelogs) contain stale references and outdated counts. A systematic audit is needed, but attempting a single monolithic specification would be too complex for agent execution.

### Constraints
- 11 source specs across 3 independent tracks (agent, spec-kit, environment)
- 200+ documentation files requiring audit
- Multiple independent audit domains (READMEs, SKILL, commands, agents)
- Need for parallelizable agent execution
- Dependency chain for changelog creation and release
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Create umbrella specification (spec 130) with 7 self-contained task specifications, each defining a specific audit domain with explicit dependencies.

**Details**: Root spec provides executive overview, dependency graph, and consolidated changelog reference. Each task folder contains complete Level 3+ documentation enabling independent agent execution. Tasks 01-04 run in parallel (no dependencies), then Task 05 (depends on 01-04), then Task 06 (depends on 05), then Task 07 (depends on 06).

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Umbrella + 7 task specs** | Parallelizable, self-contained, clear dependencies | More upfront spec work | 9/10 |
| Single monolithic spec | Fewer files, simpler structure | Too complex for agent, no parallelization | 4/10 |
| Issue-based tracking | Agile, flexible | No systematic audit, easy to miss files | 5/10 |
| Script-based automation | Fast execution | Brittle, hard to verify completeness | 6/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Umbrella approach enables parallel agent execution (Tasks 01-04), provides clear dependency ordering (05 → 06 → 07), and ensures systematic coverage through self-contained task specifications with explicit file lists.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Tasks 01-04 can run simultaneously (4x speedup)
- Each task spec is self-contained (agent can execute independently)
- Clear dependency chain prevents premature releases
- Systematic coverage ensures no files missed

**Negative**:
- More upfront specification work (7 task folders vs. 1 spec) - Mitigation: Templates reduce per-task effort
- Coordination overhead for umbrella structure - Mitigation: Dependency graph and clear blocking rules

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Task specs not truly self-contained | M | Review pass checking agent executability |
| Dependency chain creates bottleneck | L | Parallel 01-04 reduces total time |
| Scope creep into implementation | H | Strict boundary enforcement (spec-only) |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | 200+ documentation files have stale references post-implementation |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered monolithic, issue-based, script-based approaches |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | 7-task decomposition matches natural audit domains |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly enables systematic documentation alignment |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Reusable pattern for future multi-track alignments |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-001-five-checks -->

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- Spec folder system (creation of 130/ with 7 task subfolders)
- SpecKit template system (Level 3+ templates)
- Validation system (validate.sh, check-placeholders.sh)

**Rollback**: Delete 130/ folder if umbrella approach proves too complex; fall back to issue-based tracking

## ADR-002: Self-Contained Task Specifications

### Metadata

| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-16 |
| **Deciders** | Michel, @speckit agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->
### Context

Each task specification must enable an agent to execute the audit work without reading other task specs or external context. Insufficient context leads to agent confusion; excessive context creates cognitive load.

### Constraints
- Agents have limited context windows
- Task specs must be independently executable
- Need balance between completeness and conciseness
- Explicit file lists required (no wildcards)
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Each task spec includes full context (source spec references, file paths, audit criteria, acceptance criteria) sufficient for independent agent execution.

**Details**: Task specs list every file to audit by full path, provide explicit audit criteria (what to look for), and include enough source spec context to understand what changed. No wildcards, no references to other task specs, no assumptions of external knowledge.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Full context per task** | Self-contained, agent-executable | More repetition across tasks | 9/10 |
| Minimal context + root reference | Less repetition | Agent must read root spec | 6/10 |
| Shared context file | DRY principle | Breaks self-containment | 5/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Self-containment is more valuable than avoiding repetition. Agents can execute tasks independently without context-switching between documents.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Agent can start task immediately without research phase
- Parallelization possible (no shared context dependencies)
- Reduced cognitive load per task

**Negative**:
- Some context repetition across task specs - Mitigation: Templates keep repetition manageable
- Higher word count per task spec - Mitigation: Concise language and tables

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Context drift across tasks | M | Root spec as canonical reference |
| Incomplete context in task specs | H | Review pass checking agent executability |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Necessary?** | PASS | Agent cannot execute task without sufficient context |
| 2 | **Beyond Local Maxima?** | PASS | Considered minimal context and shared context approaches |
| 3 | **Sufficient?** | PASS | Full context per task matches agent execution model |
| 4 | **Fits Goal?** | PASS | Directly enables independent agent execution |
| 5 | **Open Horizons?** | PASS | Reusable pattern for future task-based specs |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-002-five-checks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-002-impl -->
### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- Task spec templates (full context sections)

## ADR-003: Dependency Ordering (Parallel + Sequential)

### Metadata

| **Status** | Accepted |
| **Date** | 2026-02-16 |
| **Deciders** | Michel, @speckit agent |

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->
### Context

Tasks 01-04 audit independent documentation domains (READMEs, SKILL, commands, agents) and have no shared dependencies. Task 05 creates changelogs from 01-04 outputs. Task 06 updates root README with consolidated changelog. Task 07 creates tagged releases after README updated.

### Constraints
- Tasks 01-04 have no dependencies
- Task 05 requires all 01-04 outputs
- Task 06 requires Task 05 output
- Task 07 requires Task 06 output
- Want to minimize total execution time
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Tasks 01-04 run in parallel (no dependencies), then Task 05 (blocked by 01-04), then Task 06 (blocked by 05), then Task 07 (blocked by 06).

**Details**: Parallel execution of 01-04 provides 4x speedup. Sequential 05 → 06 → 07 ensures changelog is consolidated before root README update, and root README is updated before release tagging.
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->
### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Parallel 01-04, Sequential 05-07** | Optimal speedup, clear dependencies | Requires coordination at Task 05 | 10/10 |
| Fully sequential | Simple, no coordination | 7x slower (no parallelization) | 4/10 |
| Fully parallel | Fastest possible | Impossible (Task 05 needs 01-04 outputs) | 0/10 |

**Why Chosen**: Balances speedup (4x for parallel 01-04) with dependency enforcement (sequential 05-07 ensures correct ordering).
<!-- /ANCHOR:adr-003-alternatives -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-003-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- 4x speedup for Tasks 01-04 (parallel execution)
- Clear blocking prevents premature releases
- Dependency graph is simple and understandable

**Negative**:
- Task 05 is a sync point (must wait for all 01-04) - Mitigation: Acceptable (necessary dependency)
- Coordination overhead at Task 05 - Mitigation: Task specs define clear inputs/outputs

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Task 01-04 durations unbalanced | L | Acceptable (still faster than sequential) |
| Task 05 bottleneck | M | Keep Task 05 scope tight (changelog creation only) |
