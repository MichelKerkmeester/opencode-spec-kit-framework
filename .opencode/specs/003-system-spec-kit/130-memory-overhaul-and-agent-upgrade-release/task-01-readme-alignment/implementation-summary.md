## What Was Built

[Implementer: Summarize README audit results. Example: "Audited 60+ README.md files across `.opencode/` directory tree, identified X stale source counts (4→5), Y stale intent counts (5→7), Z missing feature references (upgrade-level.sh, check-placeholders.sh, auto-populate workflow), and documented all required changes in changes.md with before/after text."]

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| [Implementer: List all READMEs requiring changes from changes.md] | Modified | [Specific update] |
| Example: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md` | Modified | Updated to 5 sources, 7 intents, schema v13 |
| Example: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md` | Modified | Same + added includeSpecDocs parameter |
| Example: `.opencode/README.md` | Modified | Updated statistics table counts |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| [Implementer: Document key decisions made during audit] | [Why this choice] |
| Example: Deferred spec 129 anchor tag audit for some files | Spec 129 not fully implemented at audit time |
| Example: Grouped changes.md by directory for readability | 60+ files would be unwieldy in flat list |
| Example: Marked some HVR items as P2 (defer) | Non-critical compliance items |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| P0 Files Audited | [Pass/Fail/Skip] | 3 high-priority READMEs |
| P1 Files Audited | [Pass/Fail/Skip] | 55 medium-priority READMEs |
| P2 Compliance Check | [Pass/Fail/Skip] | 60+ files for anchor tags + HVR |
| changes.md Complete | [Pass/Fail/Skip] | No placeholder text, before/after present |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

[Implementer: Document any limitations or deferred work. Examples:]
- Some P2 items deferred pending spec 129 full implementation
- Anchor tag compliance deferred for low-traffic READMEs
- Future: Automate README staleness detection in CI/CD

[Or state "None" if all work completed]
