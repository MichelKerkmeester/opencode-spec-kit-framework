# Implementation Plan: MCP Server Failures After Updates

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | Node.js, MCP Server (TypeScript) |
| **Framework** | Model Context Protocol |
| **Storage** | SQLite (better-sqlite3) |
| **Testing** | Manual testing, MCP connection validation |

### Overview
This plan guides the investigation of MCP server failures after system updates, tests the hypothesis that node_modules relocation is the root cause, and defines the approach for updating the install guide with comprehensive debugging and recovery procedures.

<!-- ANCHOR:quality-gates -->
## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [x] Problem statement clear: Users experiencing MCP failures post-update
- [x] Hypothesis documented: node_modules relocation may be the cause
- [x] Target file identified: MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md install guide

### Definition of Done
- [x] Root cause(s) identified with supporting evidence [Evidence: Fallback build process, native module dependencies]
- [x] Install guide updated with debugging section [Evidence: `.opencode/install_guides/MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md` rewritten]
- [x] All common error scenarios documented with recovery procedures [Evidence: Error reference and troubleshooting sections added]
- [x] Manual testing confirms procedures work on affected systems [Evidence: npm install + build, native module check, startup test, full installer run]

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Documentation/Investigation → no code architecture changes

### Key Components
- **MCP Server**: The Spec Kit Memory MCP server that fails after updates
- **Install Guide**: User-facing documentation for setup and troubleshooting
- **Debugging Workflow**: New procedural guide for diagnosing failures

### Data Flow
User Update → MCP Server Failure → User Consults Install Guide → Debugging Section → Root Cause Identified → Recovery Procedure → Server Restored
<!-- /ANCHOR:architecture -->

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Investigation
- [x] Review user error reports and logs
- [x] Examine node_modules relocation changes
- [x] Test node_modules location hypothesis
- [x] Identify other potential root causes
- [x] Document findings with evidence

### Phase 2: Documentation Update
- [x] Read current install guide thoroughly
- [x] Design debugging section structure
- [x] Write error message reference table
- [x] Document recovery procedures for each failure mode
- [x] Add health check validation steps

### Phase 3: Verification
- [x] Test procedures on system with failures
- [x] Verify error messages match documentation
- [x] Confirm recovery procedures work
- [x] Review documentation for clarity and completeness

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Manual | Reproduce failures, test recovery procedures | Local MCP server, node/npm commands |
| Validation | Verify health checks return expected results | MCP connection test, server logs |
| Documentation | Clarity and accuracy of written procedures | Peer review, user feedback |
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| User error logs/reports | External | Yellow | Limited ability to identify patterns without real-world data |
| Access to system with failures | Internal | Green | Can reproduce locally if needed |
| Node_modules change history | Internal | Green | Git history available for review |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: Updated install guide makes problems worse or introduces confusion
- **Procedure**: Git revert the install guide changes, restore previous version
<!-- /ANCHOR:rollback -->

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-deps -->
## L2: PHASE DEPENDENCIES

```
Phase 1 (Investigation) ──► Phase 2 (Documentation) ──► Phase 3 (Verification)
```

| Phase | Depends On | Blocks |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Investigation | None | Documentation |
| Documentation | Investigation | Verification |
| Verification | Documentation | None |

**Critical Path**: Investigation findings directly determine documentation content. Cannot write accurate procedures without understanding root causes.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-deps -->

<!-- ANCHOR:effort -->
## L2: EFFORT ESTIMATION

| Phase | Complexity | Estimated Effort |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Investigation | High | 2-4 hours (hypothesis testing, error reproduction, root cause analysis) |
| Documentation Update | Medium | 2-3 hours (write debugging section, error reference, recovery procedures) |
| Verification | Medium | 1-2 hours (test procedures, validate accuracy, review) |
| **Total** | | **5-9 hours** |
<!-- /ANCHOR:effort -->

<!-- ANCHOR:enhanced-rollback -->
## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [x] Current install guide backed up [Evidence: Git version control]
- [x] Changes reviewed for accuracy and clarity [Evidence: workflows-documentation skill validation]
- [x] At least one test user validates procedures work [Evidence: Developer testing completed]

### Rollback Procedure
1. Git revert commit with install guide changes
2. Verify old install guide is accessible to users
3. Notify users if significant guidance was distributed
4. Document what didn't work for future iteration

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No
- **Reversal procedure**: N/A - documentation changes only
