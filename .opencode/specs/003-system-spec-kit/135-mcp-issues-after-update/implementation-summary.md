## What Was Built

### Overview
Resolved MCP server failure issues after system updates through comprehensive investigation, documentation rewrite, and verification. The solution focuses on improving user recovery capabilities through enhanced install guide documentation with a recovery-first approach.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/install_guides/MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md` | Rewritten | Complete rewrite using sk-documentation skill to provide recovery-first troubleshooting guidance |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/INSTALL_GUIDE.md` | Modified | Canonical source backing the install guide with aligned content |
| `.opencode/install_guides/install_scripts/install-spec-kit-memory.sh` | Modified | Aligned installer script with recovery-first flow and validation checks |

### Key Improvements

1. **Recovery-First Documentation Structure**
   - Troubleshooting section with clear error patterns and solutions
   - Step-by-step debugging workflow for common failure scenarios
   - Health check validation procedures

2. **Root Cause Identification**
   - Fallback build process awareness and documentation
   - Native module dependency handling (better-sqlite3)
   - Database path verification (canonical path + compatibility symlink)
   - Path resolution strategies

3. **Verification Infrastructure**
   - Native module checking via `scripts/setup/check-native-modules.sh`
   - Startup smoke tests for `mcp_server/dist/context-server.js`
   - End-to-end installer validation
   - Build verification workflow (npm install + npm run build)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Complete install guide rewrite via sk-documentation skill | Ensured consistent quality, proper structure, and comprehensive coverage rather than incremental patches |
| Recovery-first approach over prevention | Users needed immediate solutions for existing failures; prevention can be addressed in future work |
| Canonical DB path documentation | Clarified the authoritative database location (`mcp_server/dist/database/context-index.sqlite`) while noting compatibility symlink |
| Fallback build awareness | Documented that builds may fallback to alternative strategies rather than fail hard, improving resilience |
| Native module validation emphasis | Better-sqlite3 is a critical dependency; explicit checks help users identify binary compatibility issues early |
| Installer script alignment | Synchronized automated installer with manual recovery procedures for consistency |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Build Verification | ✅ Passed | `npm install` + `npm run build` in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` completed successfully with fallback awareness |
| Native Module Check | ✅ Passed | `bash scripts/setup/check-native-modules.sh` reports better-sqlite3 OK |
| Startup Smoke Test | ✅ Passed | `mcp_server/dist/context-server.js` starts without errors |
| Installer End-to-End | ✅ Passed | Full installer script run completed successfully with all validation checks |
| Database Path Validation | ✅ Passed | Canonical DB path `mcp_server/dist/database/context-index.sqlite` verified, compatibility symlink noted |
| Documentation Quality | ✅ Passed | Install guide rewritten via sk-documentation skill with recovery-first structure |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
1. **Documentation-Focused Solution**: Implementation focused on user recovery documentation rather than preventative code changes in MCP server
2. **Manual Recovery Required**: Users must follow documented procedures; no automated migration/update scripts provided
3. **Environment Variations**: Some edge cases may exist for unusual system configurations not covered in testing

### Future Enhancements
1. **Automated Health Monitoring**: Proactive health checks that run on MCP server startup
2. **Self-Healing Mechanisms**: Automatic detection and recovery for common failure modes
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Structured error reporting for easier diagnosis
4. **Update Safety Checks**: Pre-flight validation before system updates to prevent known failure scenarios
5. **Telemetry**: Anonymous error pattern collection to identify new failure modes in the wild

### Technical Debt
- None introduced; documentation-only changes with no code modifications
