## What Was Built

The phase system moved from proposal into implemented behavior across scripts, command routing, and documentation surfaces. The core flow now exists end-to-end: phase recommendation, phase folder scaffolding, phase-aware command routing, and recursive validation scaffolding are all represented as completed tasks in this spec.

### Core capabilities now in place

- Phase detection and scoring were implemented in the recommendation pipeline (`T001-T004`).
- Phase creation behavior and template addendum injection were implemented in creation workflows (`T006-T012`).
- Router and command integration for phase-aware workflows were implemented (`T013-T023`).
- Recursive validation plumbing, phase-link rule support, and node/reference documentation updates were implemented (`T024-T027`, `T029-T032`, `T034`).

### What is still open

Three fixture-oriented verification tasks remain open in `tasks.md`: `T005`, `T028`, and `T033`. This means implementation is largely complete, but fixture-backed verification closure is not yet complete.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed the four planned execution phases in `plan.md`: detection/scoring, templates/creation, commands/router, and validation/docs/nodes. Work was tracked in `tasks.md`, where 31 of 34 tasks are marked complete.

State reconciliation was performed by aligning checklist status with task reality and documenting remaining verification debt explicitly. This removed the prior mismatch where `tasks.md` showed broad completion but `checklist.md` still reflected all-zero verification progress.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep phases as a behavioral layer, not a new level tier | Preserves the existing L1/L2/L3/L3+ model while enabling decomposition across any level. |
| Keep `--phase` and `--subfolder` semantically distinct | Prevents conflating execution decomposition with version iteration. |
| Use conservative phase recommendation thresholds | Reduces over-suggestion and keeps simple workflows fast. |
| Track completion state directly from task evidence | Prevents checklist drift and keeps verification status auditable. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Task execution status | PARTIAL - 31/34 complete (`tasks.md`), pending `T005`, `T028`, `T033` |
| Checklist/task synchronization | PASS - `checklist.md` now mirrors `tasks.md` state, including pending fixture work |
| Required Level 3+ artifact presence | PASS - `implementation-summary.md` now present in root spec folder |
| Final fixture-driven closure | PENDING - requires completion of the three open fixture tasks |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Fixture backlog remains open.** Tasks `T005`, `T028`, and `T033` are still pending, so verification cannot be marked fully complete.
2. **Sign-off gates remain pending.** Governance checkpoints in `checklist.md` and final acceptance in `spec.md` are not yet closed.
3. **Full backward-compatibility evidence is not yet recorded.** The 51-fixture regression expectation is documented, but final run evidence is still pending.
