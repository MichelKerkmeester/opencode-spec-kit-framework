# Feature Specification: SpecKit Phase System

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.2 -->

<!-- WHEN TO USE THIS TEMPLATE:
Level 3+ (+Govern) is appropriate when:
- Enterprise-scale changes with high visibility
- Formal approval workflow required
- Compliance checkpoints needed (SOX, HIPAA, etc.)
- Stakeholder matrix with sign-off tracking
- Changelog with version history
- AI execution protocols for multi-agent coordination
- Complexity score 80-100

DO NOT use Level 3+ if:
- Standard complex feature without governance (use Level 3)
- No formal approvals required (use Level 3)
- Compliance not mandated (use Level 3)
- Single-agent execution sufficient (use Level 3)
-->

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The SpecKit Phase System formalizes the organic sub-folder pattern observed in specs 136 and 138 into a first-class, AI-assisted workflow that proactively detects large tasks and guides decomposition into structured phase folders before work begins. This replaces the current manual, after-the-fact sub-folder creation with intelligent up-front phase planning.

**Key Decisions**: (1) Phases are a behavioral layer on top of existing levels, not a new level tier; (2) Auto-suggestion via enhanced `recommend-level.sh` scoring; (3) New `/spec_kit:phase` command for phase lifecycle management.

**Critical Dependencies**: Existing `create.sh --subfolder` infrastructure, SKILL.md smart router data-driven architecture.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

Large, multi-session tasks (500+ LOC, 15+ files, cross-domain scope) currently produce monolithic spec folders whose documentation grows unwieldy and whose context files balloon beyond useful retrieval limits. The sub-folder pattern that evolved organically in specs 136 (7 phases) and 138 (3 workstreams) proves the pattern works, but AI agents have no systematic awareness of when to suggest phasing, how to create phase structures, or how to validate them as cohesive units. Today, sub-folder creation is entirely manual and after-the-fact.

### Purpose

AI agents proactively detect tasks that warrant phased execution, suggest structured decomposition before work begins, create properly linked parent/child spec folders, and validate them as integrated units - reducing rework, context overload, and documentation drift in complex multi-session projects.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Phase detection scoring in `recommend-level.sh` (new `--recommend-phases` output)
- SKILL.md smart router: new PHASE intent signal with keyword triggers and resource mapping
- New `/spec_kit:phase` command with auto/confirm modes and YAML workflow assets
- Enhanced `create.sh` with `--phase` mode (parent+child creation, phase metadata injection)
- Recursive validation via `validate.sh --recursive` for parent+child phase folders
- Phase-aware Gate 3: new Option E "Add phase to existing spec" in CLAUDE.md
- Parent spec template addendum with Phase Documentation Map and phase-linkage fields
- Child phase template with parent back-reference fields and handoff criteria
- New `nodes/phase-system.md` graph mode node
- New `references/structure/phase_definitions.md` reference document
- Updates to `sub_folder_versioning.md`, `level_specifications.md`, `template_guide.md`, `quick_reference.md`
- Updates to existing commands: `/spec_kit:plan`, `/spec_kit:implement`, `/spec_kit:complete`, `/spec_kit:resume`

### Out of Scope
- Memory MCP server changes - Phase system uses existing memory infrastructure as-is
- Sharded template integration - Sharded system remains a parallel alternative, not merged
- compose.sh modifications - Phase templates composed manually, not via compose.sh pipeline
- Level tier changes - Phases are behavioral, not a new documentation level
- Cross-spec-folder phase linking - Phases must live under a single parent spec folder
- Automated phase transition (auto-advancing from phase N to N+1) - Remains user-driven

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Existing `create.sh --subfolder` infrastructure (working, tested) | Phase creation blocked if broken | Verify existing tests pass before extending |
| Dependency | SKILL.md smart router data-driven dict architecture (extensible by design) | Router changes required if architecture changes | Design additive dict entries only |
| Dependency | `validate.sh` plugin-based rule architecture (14 rules, source-and-execute pattern) | Recursive validation depends on plugin system | Extend via existing plugin mechanism |
| Dependency | Existing command structure pattern (md + 2 YAML assets per command) | Inconsistent UX if pattern changes | Mirror existing command file layout exactly |
| Risk | Over-suggestion: AI recommends phases for tasks that don't need them | Medium | Conservative thresholds; require both high score AND multi-domain signals |
| Risk | Phase template bloat: Too many files per phase folder | High | Use Level 1-2 for child phases by default; only parent needs L3+ |
| Risk | Context window pressure: Parent + multiple child docs in single session | High | Sharded loading; only load active phase docs |
| Risk | Gate 3 complexity: 5 options (A-E) may confuse users | Medium | Option E only shown when existing spec has phased content or high complexity |
| Risk | Command path resolution brittleness: nested paths harder to resolve | Medium | Leverage existing generate-context.js path resolution (4 formats supported) |
| Risk | Backward compatibility: existing non-phased specs must continue working | High | Phase features are purely additive; all flags optional |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: `recommend-level.sh --recommend-phases` adds < 50ms to scoring time
- **NFR-P02**: `validate.sh --recursive` on 7-phase parent completes in < 10s

### Compatibility
- **NFR-C01**: All existing non-phased spec folders validate identically with or without `--recursive`
- **NFR-C02**: Bash 4.0+ compatibility maintained (no Bash 5+ features)

### Usability
- **NFR-U01**: Phase suggestion message includes concrete phase decomposition rationale
- **NFR-U02**: `/spec_kit:phase` follows identical UX patterns as existing commands

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Phase templates use CORE + ADDENDUM composition (no separate maintenance branch)

### Extensibility
- **NFR-E01**: Phase scoring dimensions configurable via `.speckit.yaml` overrides
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Phase Structure Boundaries
- EC-01 - Single-phase parent (user creates parent but only ever needs 1 phase): Valid; degenerate case equivalent to standard spec folder with one sub-folder
- EC-02 - Phase folder created but never populated (empty child): `validate.sh` warns about empty phase; does not error
- EC-03 - Parent has phases but user runs flat validate (no `--recursive`): Validates parent only; no error; warns if child folders detected
- EC-04 - Phase numbering gap (001, 002, 005 - skip 003/004): `create.sh` uses max+1 logic; skipped numbers are valid (no renumbering)
- EC-05 - Mixed levels: parent is L3+, child phases are L1: Valid; each folder's level is independent. Parent level does not cascade

### Error Scenarios
- EC-06 - Recommend-level suggests phases but user declines: System proceeds without phases; no persistent flag or penalty
- EC-07 - Existing sub-folder (versioning) vs new phase (semantic): Phase flag distinguishes: `--phase` creates phase metadata; `--subfolder` creates version iteration
- EC-08 - Phase created in wrong parent folder: `validate.sh` parent-child link check fails; error with corrective guidance

|-----------|-------|----------|
| Scope | 22/25 | Files: 20+, LOC: 500+, Systems: 6 subsystems modified/created |
| Risk | 14/20 | Backward compatibility critical; over-suggestion risk; path resolution complexity |
| Research | 18/20 | Deep integration with SKILL.md router, Gate 3, validation pipeline, command system, and template architecture; formalizing emergent pattern requires deep understanding of existing organic usage |
| Multi-Agent | 8/15 | Single developer/maintainer; no cross-team coordination needed |

## 10. RISK MATRIX

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|------------|
| R-01 | Over-suggestion of phases | Medium | Medium | Conservative thresholds (score >= 70 AND architectural AND files > 15); user always has decline option |
| R-02 | Context window overflow with multi-phase docs | High | Medium | Default to L1/L2 for child phases; sharded parent loading; active-phase-only context |
| R-03 | Path resolution failures across commands | Medium | Medium | Reuse generate-context.js 4-format path resolver; comprehensive test fixtures |
| R-04 | Backward compatibility regression | High | Low | All phase features behind --phase/--recursive flags; existing behavior unchanged by default |
| R-05 | Template maintenance burden | Medium | Low | Phase addendum is small (~30 lines); composed via existing CORE + ADDENDUM pattern |
| R-06 | Gate 3 option overload (5 options) | Medium | Low | Option E contextually shown only when high-complexity existing spec detected |

<!-- ANCHOR:user-stories -->
## 11. USER STORIES

### US-01: AI Suggests Phased Approach
**As an** AI agent processing a complex task request (e.g., "Build a hybrid RAG search system"),
**I want to** automatically detect that the task exceeds single-spec-folder complexity thresholds,
**So that** I proactively suggest a phased approach before the user starts working, reducing rework.

**Acceptance**: When `recommend-level.sh --json --loc 2000 --files 25 --architectural --api --db` runs, output includes `"recommended_phases": true, "suggested_phase_count": 3`.

### US-02: Developer Creates Phased Spec
**As a** developer starting a large feature,
**I want to** run `/spec_kit:phase` and get a properly structured parent + child phase folders,
**So that** each phase can be planned, implemented, and validated independently.

**Acceptance**: Running the command creates parent with Phase Documentation Map, child 001 with parent back-references, and both pass validate.sh.

### US-03: Validation Across Phases
**As a** developer completing a multi-phase project,
**I want to** run `validate.sh --recursive` on the parent folder,
**So that** all phases and the parent are validated as an integrated unit.

**Acceptance**: Output shows per-phase results, aggregated error/warning counts, and combined exit code.

### US-04: Resume Work on Specific Phase
**As a** developer resuming work after a break,
**I want to** run `/spec_kit:resume specs/136-hybrid-rag/003-memory-quality/`,
**So that** only phase 003's context is loaded without polluting my context with other phases.

**Acceptance**: Resume correctly loads only child phase memory files, not sibling phases.

## 16. OPEN QUESTIONS

- OQ-01: Should phase child folders default to L1 or inherit parent's level? (Impact: Template design) — Proposed: Default L1, allow --level override
- OQ-02: Should `--phase` mode in create.sh be a separate script or integrated? (Impact: Code organization) — Proposed: Integrated in create.sh (consistent with --subfolder)
- OQ-03: Should Phase Documentation Map be a mandatory section for all L3+ specs or only phased ones? (Impact: Template impact) — Proposed: Optional section, only injected by --phase mode
- OQ-04: Should the sharded template system be leveraged for parent specs to enable selective phase loading? (Impact: Token efficiency) — Proposed: P2 enhancement, not blocking
- OQ-05: How should phase numbering interact with existing sub-folder versioning? (Impact: Create.sh logic) — Proposed: --phase creates phases, --subfolder creates versions; mutually exclusive flags
