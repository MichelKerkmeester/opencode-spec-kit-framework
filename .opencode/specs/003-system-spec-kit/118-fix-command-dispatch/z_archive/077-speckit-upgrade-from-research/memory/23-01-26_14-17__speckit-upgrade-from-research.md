<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. OVERVIEW

Conducted comprehensive Level 3+ compliance remediation for spec 077-speckit-upgrade-from-research. This spec consolidates four research specifications (060-063) into a unified SpecKit upgrade plan. The session involved dispatching 20 parallel Opus research agents to analyze the system-spec-kit skill, commands, and memory MCP server, then fixing 6 critical issues: date errors (2025 to 2026), state file scope contradictions, version misalignments, missing L3+ checklist sections, and source reference inconsistencies. Achieved 100% Level 3+ compliance (up from approximately 55%).

**Key Outcomes**:
- Fixed all date errors (2025 to 2026) across spec documents
- Changed Decision 5 status to SUPERSEDED (state file out-of-scope)
- Rewrote FR-1 from 'State File Tracking' to 'Memory-Based State Persistence'
- Added 4 Level 3+ sections to checklist.md (Architecture, Performance, Deployment Readiness, Compliance)
- Fixed source references to point to research/ synthesis documents
- Achieved 100% Level 3+ compliance

## 2. DECISIONS

### Decision 1: State File Scope Superseded
- **Decision**: Changed Decision 5 status to SUPERSEDED
- **Rationale**: State file (.spec-state.json) was marked out-of-scope during scope refinement, memory-based approach sufficient
- **Impact**: FR-1 requirements must be rewritten to align with scope

### Decision 2: Memory-Based State Persistence
- **Decision**: Rewrote FR-1 from 'State File Tracking' to 'Memory-Based State Persistence'
- **Rationale**: spec.md Out-of-Scope section conflicted with FR-1 requirements defining state file implementation as P0
- **Impact**: Consistent with memory-only approach across all documents

### Decision 3: Resume Priority Order Update
- **Decision**: Updated resume priority order to memory-only (no state file)
- **Rationale**: Consistent with scope decisions across all documents
- **Impact**: Tasks.md and plan.md updated to reflect memory-based approach

### Decision 4: Level 3+ Checklist Enhancement
- **Decision**: Added 4 Level 3+ sections to checklist.md (Architecture, Performance, Deployment Readiness, Compliance)
- **Rationale**: Original checklist lacked L3+ verification requirements
- **Impact**: Proper Level 3+ documentation structure now complete

### Decision 5: Source Reference Correction
- **Decision**: Fixed source references to point to research/ synthesis documents
- **Rationale**: 060-063 spec folders don't exist - research was external synthesis
- **Impact**: All references now correctly point to actual synthesis documents

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-memory-and-spec-kit/077-speckit-upgrade-from-research` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-memory-and-spec-kit/077-speckit-upgrade-from-research" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
