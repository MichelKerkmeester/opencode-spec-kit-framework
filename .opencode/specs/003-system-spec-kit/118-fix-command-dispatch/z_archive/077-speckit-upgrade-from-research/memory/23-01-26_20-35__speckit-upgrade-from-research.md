<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. OVERVIEW

Session focused on completing the AGENTS.md simplification and SpecKit upgrade work, including syncing changes to Public and Barter repositories.

**Summary of Work Done:**
1. Fixed 8 HIGH severity alignment issues in documentation
2. Synced skill_advisor.py to Public and Barter repos
3. Verified all changes, updated READMEs in touched subfolders
4. Audited script folder organization - moved decision-tree-generator.js and opencode-capture.js to correct locations
5. Fixed import paths in 5 files after script moves
6. Simplified AGENTS.md - removed over-engineered verbose sections
7. Fixed minor issues: templates/verbose/ description, removed missing index-cli.js from package.json
8. Updated Public AGENTS.md with new features
9. Updated Barter AGENTS.md with new features

**Key Outcomes**:
- AGENTS.md simplified and synced across all three repositories
- Script folder organization corrected with import paths fixed
- All HIGH severity alignment issues resolved
- Public and Barter repos updated with new features

## 2. DECISIONS

**Key Technical Decisions Made:**

### D1: Dual-Threshold Validation
- **Decision:** READINESS = (confidence >= 0.70) AND (uncertainty <= 0.35)
- **Rationale:** Addresses "confident ignorance" anti-pattern where high confidence + high uncertainty leads to dangerous decisions
- **Impact:** Gate 2 now validates BOTH thresholds before proceeding

### D2: Five Checks Framework
- **Decision:** Added Five Checks Framework for architectural decisions at Level 3/3+
- **Checks:** Necessary? Beyond Local Maxima? Sufficient? Fits Goal? Open Horizons?
- **Usage:** Required for Level 3/3+ spec folders, recommended for Level 2

### D3: Agent Routing (Section 6)
- **Decision:** Added Agent Routing as dedicated Section 6 in AGENTS.md
- **Agents:** @general, @explore, @orchestrate, @research, @write, @review, @speckit, @debug, @handover
- **Rationale:** Centralizes agent selection guidance for Task tool usage

### D4: Gate Renumbering
- **Decision:** Renumbered gates for clarity
  - Gate 1 = Spec Folder Question
  - Gate 2 = Understanding + Context Surfacing
  - Gate 3 = Skill Routing
- **Rationale:** Previous numbering caused confusion; new order reflects execution flow

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-memory-and-spec-kit/077-speckit-upgrade-from-research` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-memory-and-spec-kit/077-speckit-upgrade-from-research" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
