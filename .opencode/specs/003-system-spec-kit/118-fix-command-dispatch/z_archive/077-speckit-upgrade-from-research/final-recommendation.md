# Final Recommendation: SpecKit System Upgrade

> **Executive Recommendation Document**
> Synthesized from 4 research specifications using ~40 Opus 4.5 agents
> Date: 2026-01-22 | System Version: v1.0.6.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:** Four research specifications (060-063) identified 130+ improvement patterns for the SpecKit system. After filtering for environment constraints and scope refinement, **9 actionable items remain** that will measurably improve agent reliability, context preservation, and decision quality.

**The Constraint:** OpenCode lacks lifecycle hooks, and several items (state file, status dashboard, quick mode, overlays, git notes, npm distribution) have been deferred or removed from scope.

**The Recommendation:** Implement in 3 phases over 3-4 weeks, focusing on epistemic awareness and decision quality.

**Expected ROI:**
- 40-60% reduction in context loss during session transitions
- Measurable improvement in agent decision confidence calibration
- Systematic framework for evaluating all future changes

## 3.1 Feature Outlines

### 1. Explicit Uncertainty Tracking (P0)
Add a separate uncertainty field (0.0-1.0) distinct from confidence. Uncertainty measures "what I don't know that I don't know" - epistemic gaps, model boundaries, temporal variability, and situational completeness. High confidence + high uncertainty = "confident ignorance" (dangerous). This field enables the dual-threshold validation gate.

### 2. Dual-Threshold Validation (P0)
Implement a readiness gate requiring BOTH: `know >= 0.70` AND `uncertainty <= 0.35`. Single confidence percentages are insufficient - an agent can be 90% confident while having 60% uncertainty about unknowns. If either threshold fails, the agent must INVESTIGATE (loop back max 3x) before proceeding with file modifications.

### 3. PREFLIGHT Baseline Capture (P0)
Capture epistemic baseline BEFORE starting any task: current know score, uncertainty level, and context understanding. Store in memory files with timestamps. This baseline enables measuring actual learning - without it, we cannot calculate deltas or demonstrate improvement across sessions.

### 4. POSTFLIGHT Delta Calculation (P0)
After task completion, reassess the same vectors and calculate deltas: `Δknow = POST.know - PRE.know`, `Δuncertainty = PRE.uncertainty - POST.uncertainty`. Positive learning shows knowledge gained; negative uncertainty shows doubt reduced. Store deltas for calibration feedback and session compounding.

### 5. Enhanced Resume Detection (P1)
Improve resume reliability with explicit priority order: (1) Recent memory files with `status: active` anchor, (2) Memory files < 24 hours old, (3) Last modified spec folder heuristic, (4) User-provided path. Clear messaging indicates which signal triggered resume. Fallback gracefully when signals conflict.

### 6. Five Checks Framework (P1)
Before any significant decision (>100 LOC or architectural), evaluate: (1) Necessary? - actual need now, (2) Beyond Local Maxima? - explored alternatives, (3) Sufficient? - simplest approach, (4) Fits Goal? - stays on critical path, (5) Open Horizons? - long-term alignment. Each check requires explicit PASS/FAIL with rationale.

### 7. Structured Decision Format (P1)
Standardize all gate responses with: `GATE: [name]`, `DECISION: PASS|BLOCK`, `CONFIDENCE: HIGH|MED|LOW`, `UNCERTAINTY: [0.0-1.0]`, `EVIDENCE: [citation]`. BLOCK decisions MUST include `RESOLUTION_PATH` (how to unblock) and `ALTERNATIVE` (suggested approach). Enables auditing and consistency.

### 8. skill_advisor.py Uncertainty (P1)
Enhance skill routing with dual-threshold: if `confidence >= 0.8` AND `uncertainty <= 0.35`, recommend skill. Otherwise, recommend general approach with caveats. Output includes both scores so routing decisions are transparent. Prevents routing to specialized skills when requirements are unclear.

### 9. Decision Journaling (P2)
Extended audit trail capturing: timestamp, session_id, decision_type, gate name, decision (PASS/BLOCK), confidence, evidence, and context (spec folder, task, files read). Queryable by session/spec/gate. Enables post-session retrospectives and debugging of decision patterns over time.

## 4. Quick Wins

**Implement immediately with minimal risk:**

### Win 1: Five Checks Framework (1-2 hours)
```
Before ANY significant decision, verify:
□ NECESSARY: Does this solve an actual need NOW?
□ BEYOND LOCAL MAXIMA: Have I explored alternatives?
□ SUFFICIENT: Is this the simplest approach that works?
□ FITS GOAL: Does this stay on the critical path?
□ OPEN HORIZONS: Does this align with long-term architecture?
```
**Why now:** Self-contained, immediately usable, no dependencies.

### Win 2: Structured Decision Format (1 hour)
```
GATE DECISION: [GATE_NAME]
├─ Status: PASS | BLOCK | DEFER
├─ Confidence: [0.0-1.0]
├─ Evidence: [citation or "NONE"]
└─ Rationale: [one sentence]
```
**Why now:** Documentation change only, improves all future decisions.

### Win 3: Uncertainty Tracking (2-3 hours)
Add explicit uncertainty field (0.0-1.0) separate from confidence.
**Why now:** Prevents "confident ignorance" - foundation for dual-threshold validation.

### Win 4: Enhanced Resume Detection (2-3 hours)
Improve memory-based resume with priority order.
**Why now:** High-frequency pain point, low risk.

|---------------|--------|--------------|
| `.spec-state.json` state file | Scope reduction; memory-based approach sufficient | Clear reliability need |
| `/spec_kit:status` dashboard | Scope reduction; not critical path | UX improvement request |
| `:quick` mode for commands | Scope reduction; adds complexity | User demand |
| Domain-specific overlays | High effort; not critical path | Architecture need |
| Git notes integration | Medium effort; existing backup sufficient | Distributed team need |
| Retrospective HTML reports | High effort; low immediate value | Analysis need |

| LanceDB migration | SQLite sufficient at current scale | 10K+ memory files |
| Full 13-vector epistemic system | Diminishing returns; 4-5 vectors sufficient | Research shows clear benefit |
