# Implementation Summary: SpecKit Reimagined Refinement (089)

## Overview
- Comprehensive audit and remediation of system-spec-kit ecosystem
- 36/37 tasks completed across 4 phases, 1 deferred
- ~23 edits applied this session, many fixes pre-applied from prior research session
- 19 sub-agents dispatched across 3 waves + post-implementation corrections

## Phase Results

### Phase 1 — P0 CRITICAL (5/5)
- Task 1.1: Path resolution in content-filter.js — fixed (2 dirs to 3 + config/)
- Task 1.2: snake_case alignment in filters.jsonc — fixed (7 keys renamed)
- Task 1.3: SQL injection LIKE escaping — escapeLikePattern() implemented and exported
- Task 1.4: LOC counts reconciled across SKILL.md, level_specifications.md, level_selection_guide.md
- Task 1.5: Voyage model version — updated to voyage-4 in environment_variables.md

### Phase 2 — P1 HIGH (19/19)
- Tasks 2.1-2.2: Scripts — validate.sh eval replaced with case statement, create.sh %d to %s for "3+"
- Tasks 2.3.*: SKILL.md — 10 fixes (6 naming verified as AGENTS.md, 4 detail/accuracy, Level 1-3 to 1-3+)
- Tasks 2.4.*: References — 13 cross-ref fixes (4 validate-spec.sh paths corrected this session)
- Tasks 2.5.*: Assets — 4 fixes including Level 3+ support in 3 asset files
- Tasks 2.6.*: Agents — 7 frontmatter fixes including write.md task permission

### Phase 3 — P2 MEDIUM (6/6)
- Tasks 3.1-3.4: Config/scripts cleanup — dead sections labeled, phantom entries removed
- Task 3.5: level_selection_guide.md — deprecated content consolidated to Appendix
- Task 3.6: 081 pre-analysis — archived with SUPERSEDED headers

### Phase 4 — LOW (6/7, 1 deferred)
- Task 4.1: memory-search.js — indentation normalized (2 to 6 space)
- Task 4.2: DEFERRED — ALLOWED_BASE_PATHS consolidation (3 files with different path sets, regression risk)
- Tasks 4.3-4.7: Already applied (min word length, JSONC parser, model versions, tool count, date format)

## Files Modified This Session
Key files that received edits (not pre-applied):

1. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` — Level 1-3 to 1-3+ (2 edits)
2. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/references/templates/level_specifications.md` — LOC counts (5 edits)
3. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/references/templates/level_selection_guide.md` — LOC + deprecated content
4. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/references/config/environment_variables.md` — Voyage + validate-spec.sh path
5. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/references/validation/validation_rules.md` — validate-spec.sh paths (3 edits)
6. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/assets/level_decision_matrix.md` — Level 3+
7. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/assets/parallel_dispatch_config.md` — Level 3+
8. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/assets/template_mapping.md` — Level 3+
9. `.opencode/agent/write.md` — task permission (deny → allow → deny, reverted)
10. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.js` — indentation fix

## Deferred Items
- Task 4.2: ALLOWED_BASE_PATHS consolidation across 3 files (core/config.js, formatters/search-results.js, lib/search/vector-index.js). Each has different path sets. Consolidation requires deeper analysis to avoid breaking path validation. Recommend separate spec folder.

## Execution Model
- Orchestrator: 1 opus agent (context-lean, background dispatch)
- Wave 1: 7 opus workers (Phase 1+2) — all completed
- Wave 2: 2 opus workers (Phase 3+4) — all completed
- Review: 1 opus agent (checklist verification)
- Post-impl: 6 opus agents (AGENTS.md naming reversion + verification sweep)
- Total: 9 implementation + 1 review + 1 docs + 1 quality + 1 memory + 6 naming fix = 19 sub-agents

## Post-Implementation Corrections

### AGENTS.md Naming Reversion
- 8 code references reverted from `CLAUDE.md` back to `AGENTS.md` across 2 files:
  - `SKILL.md`: 6 references reverted
  - `orchestrate.md`: 2 references reverted
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical name per Spec 087; `CLAUDE.md` is only a symlink for Claude Code auto-load
- 6 Opus 4.6 agents dispatched for the fix
- Verification sweep confirmed zero incorrect `CLAUDE.md` references remaining in active framework files

### Agent Mode Reversion
- `write.md`: `task: allow` reverted to `task: deny` (OpenCode convention, not Claude Code)
- All agent modes verified as matching original OpenCode setup (v1.0.7.0):
  - `orchestrate.md`: mode: primary (no task permission)
  - `write.md`: mode: all, task: deny
  - debug/handover/research/review/speckit: mode: subagent, task: deny
- Rule: Subagents MUST have `task: deny`. Do NOT change modes to Claude Code conventions.

### Additional Files Modified
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` — 6 AGENTS.md refs reverted
- `.opencode/agent/orchestrate.md` — 2 AGENTS.md refs reverted
- `feature-summary.md` — Post-implementation corrections documented
- `implementation-summary.md` — Post-implementation corrections documented
- `checklist.md` — Updated to reflect corrections
- `tasks.md` — Updated to reflect corrections

### Updated Agent Count
- 19 total sub-agents (9 impl + 1 review + 1 docs + 1 quality + 1 memory + 6 naming fix)
- Previously reported: 13 sub-agents (before post-implementation corrections)
