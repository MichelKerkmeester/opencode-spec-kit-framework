## L2: BLOCKED TASK TRACKING

| Task ID | Blocker | Impact | Resolution |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| - | - | - | No blocked tasks |

## L2: PARALLELIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

The following tasks can be executed in parallel:

**Parallel Group A** (Phase 1 + 3 + 4):
- T001: test-session-learning.js
- T002: test-memory-handlers.js
- T004: test-validation-system.js
- T005: test-extractors-loaders.js
- T006: test-five-checks.js
- T007: test_dual_threshold.py

**Sequential Dependencies**:
- T003 depends on T001, T002 (handler tests inform integration tests)
- T008 depends on T003-T007 (template tests use patterns from all other tests)
- T010-T012 depend on T001-T008 (verification after implementation)
