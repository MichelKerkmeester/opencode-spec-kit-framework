- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Similar naming of semantic_search and semantic_memory MCPs caused confusion about which database to delete; semanticSearchDB: .

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `AGENTS.md` - Documentation

**How to Extend**:

- Reference existing implementations as patterns for new features

**Common Patterns**:

- **Data Normalization**: Clean and standardize data before use

- **Caching**: Cache expensive computations or fetches

## 2. OVERVIEW

User requested to clean and re-index the semantic memory database. During execution, discovered a critical documentation gap: AI agent confused two separate 'semantic' MCP systems (semantic_search for code indexing at .codebase/vectors.db vs semantic_memory for conversation context at .opencode/skills/workflows-memory/database/memory-index.sqlite). Root cause analysis revealed the similar naming and lack of clear disambiguation in AGENTS.md. Fixed by adding a new subsection to AGENTS.md Section 5 with a comparison table, database locations, and troubleshooting guidance. Database cleanup completed but OpenCode restart required to clear MCP server's in-memory cache before re-indexing can succeed.

**Key Outcomes**:
- User requested to clean and re-index the semantic memory database. During execution, discovered a...
- Decision 1: Added disambiguation section to AGENTS.
- Decision 2: Documented the restart requirement - MCP servers cache database stat
- Decision 3: Used Sequential Thinking MCP for systematic root cause analysis - 10
- Technical Implementation Details

## 4. DECISIONS

<!-- ANCHOR:decision-disambiguation-section-agentsmd-section-2595fa8c-session-1765957107443-e6fa46d1n -->
### Decision 1: Added disambiguation section to AGENTS.md Section 5

**Context**: Created clear table distinguishing semantic_search (.codebase/vectors.db for code) from semantic_memory (.opencode/skills/workflows-memory/database/memory-index.sqlite for conversations)

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-17T08:38:27Z

**Importance**: medium

#### Options Considered

1. **Chosen Approach**
   Added disambiguation section to AGENTS.md Section 5

#### Chosen Approach

**Selected**: Chosen Approach

**Rationale**: Created clear table distinguishing semantic_search (.codebase/vectors.db for code) from semantic_memory (.opencode/skills/workflows-memory/database/memory-index.sqlite for conversations)

#### Trade-offs

**Confidence**: 80%

<!-- ANCHOR:decision-documented-restart-requirement-e24bb2e4-session-1765957107443-e6fa46d1n -->
### Decision 2: Documented the restart requirement

**Context**: MCP servers cache database state in memory, so file deletion alone doesn't reset the index

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-17T08:38:27Z

**Importance**: medium

**Context**: 10-step process identified the naming confusion and documentation gap

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 005-memory/012-database-disambiguation` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "005-memory/012-database-disambiguation" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
