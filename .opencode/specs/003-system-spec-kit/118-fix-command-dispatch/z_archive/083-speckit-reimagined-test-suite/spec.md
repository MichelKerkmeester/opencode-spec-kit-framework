# Feature Specification: SpecKit Reimagined Test Suite

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch + level3plus-govern | v2.0 -->

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This specification defines comprehensive test coverage for the SpecKit Reimagined implementation (082-speckit-reimagined). The test suite covers 33 features across 8 categories (Search, Decay, Session, Graph, Performance, UX, Architecture, Specialized Tools), extending existing test files and adding new test coverage for 107 implementation tasks across 5 workstreams (W-S, W-R, W-D, W-G, W-I).

**Key Objectives**: Achieve 80%+ unit test coverage, 70%+ integration test coverage, and 50%+ end-to-end test coverage. Ensure all P0 requirements have dedicated test cases, validate NFRs for performance and reliability, and establish regression protection for future changes.

**Critical Dependencies**: All tests depend on the implemented modules from 082-speckit-reimagined. Key modules under test include session-manager.js, tier-classifier.js, composite-scoring.js, rrf-fusion.js, bm25-index.js, cross-encoder.js, causal-edges.js, corrections.js, archival-manager.js, provider-chain.js, envelope.js, and memory-context.js.

| **Level** | 3+ |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Status** | Draft |

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

The 082-speckit-reimagined implementation introduced 33 features with 107 implementation tasks. While some existing tests cover core functionality, comprehensive test coverage is incomplete. Current test files provide foundation coverage but gaps exist in integration testing, edge case validation, and end-to-end workflows.

**Current Test Coverage (Baseline):**

| Test File | Test Count | Coverage Area |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| tier-classifier.test.js | 78 | 5-state model, state classification, backward compatibility |
| five-factor-scoring.test.js | 65 | Multi-factor decay, composite scoring, factor weights |
| causal-edges.test.js | 29 | Causal graph, edge management, chain traversal |
| cross-encoder.test.js | 22 | Length penalty, reranking, provider availability |
| provider-chain.test.js | 28 | Embedding fallback, BM25-only mode, fallback logging |
| archival-manager.test.js | 32 | Archival detection, background jobs, statistics |
| **Total Existing** | **254** | **Partial coverage of 6 modules** |

**Gaps Requiring New Test Coverage:**
- Session deduplication (T001-T004) - No dedicated tests
- RRF fusion with convergence bonus (T020-T023) - Minimal coverage
- BM25 hybrid search (T028-T031) - No dedicated tests
- Intent-aware retrieval (T036-T039) - No dedicated tests
- Layered tool organization (T060-T063) - No dedicated tests
- Consolidation pipeline (T079-T083) - No dedicated tests
- Transaction atomicity (T105-T107) - Minimal coverage
- Memory context unified entry (T061) - No dedicated tests

### Purpose

Create a comprehensive test suite that:
1. Validates all 33 features from 082-speckit-reimagined
2. Achieves target coverage metrics (unit: 80%+, integration: 70%+, e2e: 50%+)
3. Protects against regressions during future development
4. Provides executable documentation of system behavior
5. Validates NFRs (performance, reliability, security)

---

## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

- Unit tests for all new modules (W-S, W-R, W-D, W-G, W-I workstreams)
- Integration tests for cross-module workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete user journeys
- Performance benchmarks for NFR validation
- Regression tests for backward compatibility
- Edge case and error condition coverage
- Test fixtures and mock data generators

### Out of Scope

- Load/stress testing (P2 - separate infrastructure needed)
- Security penetration testing (P3 - requires specialized tools)
- UI/visual regression testing (N/A - CLI-only system)
- Cross-platform compatibility testing (P2 - macOS primary target)

## 10. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Triggers |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Scope | 18/25 | Files: 16 new + 8 extend, LOC: 2000+, Modules: 12 |
| Risk | 15/25 | DB isolation: Y, Async complexity: Y, External mocks: Y |
| Research | 12/20 | Existing test patterns, coverage tools, mock strategies |
| Multi-Agent | 8/15 | Single workstream (testing), parallelizable by category |
| Coordination | 10/15 | Dependencies on 082 implementation, test data fixtures |
| **Total** | **63/100** | **Level 3+ appropriate for comprehensive test coverage** |

---

## 11. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries

- Empty query string -> graceful handling with default results
- Query > 10000 chars -> E040 error with truncation hint
- Zero search results -> empty array with suggestions
- Memory with no embeddings -> BM25-only search fallback

### Error Scenarios

- Database connection failure -> appropriate error code and recovery hint
- Embedding API timeout -> fallback to local or BM25-only
- Concurrent write conflicts -> transaction rollback and retry
- Corrupt memory file -> skip with warning, continue processing

### Concurrency

- Parallel session access -> isolated session state
- Concurrent memory saves -> transaction-safe indexing
- Background job conflicts -> job lock mechanism
