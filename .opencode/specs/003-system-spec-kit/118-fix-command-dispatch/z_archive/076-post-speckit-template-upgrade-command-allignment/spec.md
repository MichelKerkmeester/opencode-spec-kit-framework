# Spec 076: Post-SpecKit Template Upgrade - Command Alignment

## Overview

Comprehensive alignment of 19 OpenCode commands with command_template.md standards following SpecKit v1.9.0 CORE + ADDENDUM v2.0 template architecture upgrade.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Analysis of specs 072-075 (template, memory ranking, optimization, testing)
- Current system-spec-kit skill state assessment
- Command alignment gap identification
- Command updates/improvements based on recent SpecKit changes
- Documentation alignment with write.md and command_template.md

### Out of Scope
- New feature development
- Breaking changes to existing command interfaces
- Changes to other skills outside system-spec-kit

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ All commands aligned with current system-spec-kit capabilities
2. ✅ Command templates comply with command_template.md standards
3. ✅ Documentation follows write.md workflow requirements
4. ✅ No orphaned or deprecated functionality

## Documentation Level

**Level 3+** (Complex/Architecture Changes)
- Required: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, decision-record.md, implementation-summary.md
- Research phase: 10 Opus agents
- Implementation phase: 5 Opus agents
