## Task Notation

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[P]` | Parallelizable |
| `[B]` | Blocked |

**Task Format**: `T### [P?] Description (file path)`

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Analysis & Design

- [x] T001 Analyze upgrade-level.sh behavior for all upgrade paths (scripts/spec/upgrade-level.sh)
- [x] T002 Catalog all addendum template fragments and their placeholder patterns (templates/addendum/)
- [x] T003 Document the L2->L3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY false positive bug (spec.md section 6)
- [x] T004 Define the post-upgrade populate workflow (plan.md)

<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Workflow Definition

- [x] T005 Define context extraction rules (what to read, what to extract)
- [x] T006 Define placeholder identification rules (bracket patterns, template text)
- [x] T007 Define content derivation rules (how to map source context to target sections)
- [x] T008 Define the handling strategy for missing source context (ADR-002)

<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Demonstration & Validation

- [x] T009 Run upgrade-level.sh on spec 128 (L1 -> L3+)
- [x] T010 Auto-populate spec.md with contextual content (all L2/L3/L3+ sections)
- [x] T011 [P] Create and populate plan.md (all sections including L2/L3/L3+ addendums)
- [x] T012 [P] Populate checklist.md with spec-specific verification items
- [x] T013 [P] Populate decision-record.md with actual ADRs from this spec
- [x] T014 Create tasks.md with real implementation tasks
- [x] T015 Create implementation-summary.md documenting results

<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-4 -->
## Phase 4: Verification

- [x] T016 Grep all .md files for remaining placeholder patterns
- [x] T017 Verify all SPECKIT_LEVEL markers show 3+
- [x] T018 Confirm original user content (sections 1-6) preserved unchanged
- [x] T019 Review populated content for factual accuracy

<!-- ANCHOR:completion -->
## Completion Criteria

- [x] All tasks marked `[x]`
- [x] No `[B]` blocked tasks remaining
- [x] Zero `[placeholder]` patterns across all spec folder documents
- [x] Manual verification confirms content accuracy
