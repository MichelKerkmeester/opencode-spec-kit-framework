# Verification Checklist: Spec Kit Code Quality Initiative

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Completion claim invalid until all P0 items are checked with evidence |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must be completed or explicitly deferred with user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | May be deferred with rationale |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:evidence-format -->
## Evidence Format (Required for Checked Items)

- Use `"[EVIDENCE: <command-or-artifact>]"` on every completed P0/P1 item.
- Use command outputs or concrete artifact paths in this phase folder.
- For deferred P1/P2 items, use `"[DEFERRED: <reason>]"`.
