# Feature Specification: Spec Kit Code Quality Initiative

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase `009-spec-kit-code-quality` defines a comprehensive quality initiative for `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` and its `mcp_server`. The phase will execute full review coverage across all in-scope code, identify bloated scripts and handlers, implement KISS+DRY modular splits where justified, modernize in-scope README documentation to the latest workflow template and HVR standards, and verify that the system works at least as well as before.

**Key Decisions**: Use Level 3 governance with ADRs; run review-first execution using `sk-code--review` and `sk-code--opencode` standards before refactor implementation.

**Critical Dependencies**: Stable Node/Vitest runtime in `mcp_server`, current template guidance in `system-spec-kit`, and reliable path scoping for README updates.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The `system-spec-kit` codebase and its `mcp_server` contain quality debt across code structure, script size, and documentation consistency. Previous phases improved specific areas, but there is no single phase-owned plan that guarantees complete in-scope review coverage, disciplined KISS+DRY refactor targeting, README modernization to current templates/HVR rules, and explicit standards enforcement updates.

### Purpose
Deliver a controlled, evidence-driven quality initiative that improves maintainability and consistency while preserving or improving runtime behavior and validation outcomes.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Review all code in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server` using `sk-code--review` and `sk-code--opencode` quality lenses.
- Identify bloated scripts and modules across TypeScript, JavaScript, Shell, and Python surfaces.
- Plan and execute bounded KISS+DRY modular splits/refactors where complexity reduction is measurable.
- Verify functional behavior remains stable or improves after changes.
- Audit and update all in-scope README files to the latest workflows-documentation template and HVR standards.
- Enforce `sk-code--opencode` standards and update skill artifacts if new rules/checks become necessary.

### Out of Scope
- New product feature development unrelated to code quality.
- Broad architecture replacement across the full skill system.
- README updates in vendor/generated directories (`node_modules`, `dist`, caches, build output).
- Changes outside the `system-spec-kit` and `sk-code--opencode` ownership boundary.

### Files to Change

| File Path | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/**/*.ts` | Modify | Review and selectively refactor bloated handlers/libs with KISS+DRY boundaries |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/**/*.{sh,py,ts,js,mjs}` | Modify | Split oversized scripts and remove duplication while preserving behavior |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/**/README.md` | Modify | Apply latest workflows template + HVR style where in scope |
| `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md` | Conditional Modify | Add/adjust enforceable code standards derived from validated findings |

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | `mcp_server` test harness stability | Blocks reliable before/after verification | Lock command matrix early and run baseline snapshots first |
| Dependency | README ownership boundaries | Scope creep into non-owned docs | Enforce include/exclude manifest and touched-file audit |
| Risk | Over-refactoring | Regression risk and schedule slip | Enforce KISS boundary and prefer incremental splits |
| Risk | Incomplete review coverage | Hidden defects remain | Use explicit review coverage matrix and completion gate |
| Risk | Standards drift | Future enforcement inconsistency | Add dedicated standards propagation checkpoint |
| Risk | Refactor merges conflict | Delivery delays | Sequence refactors by module ownership and keep rollback points |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Focused verification commands complete within current expected runtime envelopes.
- **NFR-P02**: No measurable degradation in key test/runtime paths after refactors.

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Path validation and input safeguards remain intact in all touched handlers/scripts.
- **NFR-S02**: Documentation updates must not expose secrets, tokens, or local sensitive paths.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Before/after verification is reproducible from the command matrix.
- **NFR-R02**: No unresolved P0 regression remains at phase completion.

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Every selected refactor improves readability or modularity with bounded complexity.
- **NFR-M02**: Standards documentation remains synchronized with implemented practices.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Directory scans can over-include generated content unless exclusions are explicit and recursive.
- Some large scripts are intentionally monolithic due to execution ordering constraints.

### Error Scenarios
- Focused tests pass but integrated suites fail after refactor ordering changes.
- README updates conflict with active branch edits in adjacent modules.
- Standards update is needed mid-phase after a new refactor pattern emerges.

### State Transitions
- Quality state moves from partially improved to fully reviewed, refactored, and standards-aligned.
- Documentation state moves from mixed templates/style to unified latest workflow template + HVR.

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Review Everything in Scope (Priority: P0)

**As a** maintainer, **I want** complete review coverage across `system-spec-kit` and `mcp_server`, **so that** no high-risk area is left unassessed.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given in-scope directories, when review is complete, then each area has a documented findings summary.
2. Given findings, when triaged, then each item is mapped to implement/defer/reject status.

---

### US-002: Split Bloated Scripts Safely (Priority: P0)

**As a** code owner, **I want** KISS+DRY refactors for bloated scripts/modules, **so that** maintainability improves without behavior regression.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a selected hotspot, when refactored, then complexity/size decreases and contracts stay stable.
2. Given refactor completion, when tests run, then targeted and integration checks pass.

---

### US-003: Keep Documentation Modern and Consistent (Priority: P0)

**As a** documentation owner, **I want** all in-scope READMEs aligned to latest workflows template and HVR standards, **so that** guidance stays current and readable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given README inventory, when updates are applied, then each in-scope README passes template/HVR checklist.
2. Given scope boundaries, when diff is reviewed, then vendor/generated READMEs are untouched.

---

### US-004: Enforce Standards for Future Work (Priority: P1)

**As a** standards maintainer, **I want** `sk-code--opencode` artifacts updated when required, **so that** future reviews enforce the same rules used in this phase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given implemented patterns, when standards diff is reviewed, then required updates are applied or no-delta is documented.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## 12. ACCEPTANCE SCENARIOS

1. **Given** full scope review requirements, **When** phase review closes, **Then** no in-scope directory remains unreviewed.
2. **Given** bloated scripts/modules, **When** hotspot prioritization completes, **Then** top candidates have approved split plans.
3. **Given** approved refactors, **When** implementation completes, **Then** verification matrix confirms behavior integrity.
4. **Given** README modernization goals, **When** docs pass final review, **Then** all in-scope READMEs match latest template/HVR standards.
5. **Given** standards propagation requirements, **When** closure starts, **Then** `sk-code--opencode` artifacts reflect implemented rules or an evidence-backed no-delta record.
6. **Given** phase completion claim, **When** `validate.sh` runs, **Then** exit code is 0 or documented warning-only 1 with no errors.
