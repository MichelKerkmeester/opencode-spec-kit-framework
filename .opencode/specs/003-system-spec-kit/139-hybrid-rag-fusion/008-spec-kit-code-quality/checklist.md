# Verification Checklist: Spec Kit Code Quality Completion Run

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Completion claim invalid until all P0 items are checked with evidence |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must be completed or explicitly deferred with user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | May be deferred with rationale |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

<!-- ANCHOR:evidence-format -->
## Evidence Format (Mandatory for Checked Items)

- Use `"[EVIDENCE: <command or artifact path>]"` for each checked item.
- For deferred P1/P2 items, use `"[DEFERRED: <reason>]"`.
- Accepted examples:
  - `[EVIDENCE: npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server run test -- tests/query-expander.vitest.ts (pass)]`
  - `[EVIDENCE: .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/scratch/review-lane-3.md]`
  - `[EVIDENCE: node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality]`

## P0

P0 items are blocking gates and must all be checked before completion is claimed.

<!-- ANCHOR:p0 -->
- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Locked baseline triad failures are fixed and reproduced as passing. [EVIDENCE: `npx vitest run tests/graph-search-fn.vitest.ts tests/query-expander.vitest.ts tests/memory-save-extended.vitest.ts` (pass)]

[EVIDENCE: `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server run lint` (pass), `npm test` (pass), `bash scripts/tests/test-validation.sh` (55/55 pass), `bash scripts/tests/test-validation-extended.sh` (129/129 pass)]
- [x] CHK-006 [P0] Path security and MCP response contracts remain intact after edits. [EVIDENCE: `npx vitest run tests/unit-path-security.vitest.ts tests/mcp-error-format.vitest.ts` (pass)]
- [x] CHK-007 [P0] Phase documentation validates via `validate.sh` for this folder. [EVIDENCE: `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality` (pass)]
- [x] CHK-008 [P0] `implementation-summary.md` created only after implementation completion. [EVIDENCE: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/implementation-summary.md`]
- [x] CHK-009 [P0] Context saved via official `generate-context.js` script. [EVIDENCE: `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality` created `memory/23-02-26_14-34__spec-kit-code-quality.md`]

## P1

P1 items are required unless explicitly deferred with user approval.

<!-- ANCHOR:p1 -->
- [x] CHK-101 [P1] `sk-code--opencode` propagation evaluated and updated when needed. [EVIDENCE: updated `sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md` and `sk-code--opencode/README.md`; updated `system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` verifier gate]
- [x] CHK-102 [P1] `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and `decision-record.md` remain synchronized. [EVIDENCE: `validate.sh` pass with zero errors/warnings on `008-spec-kit-code-quality`]
- [x] CHK-103 [P1] Read-only review findings are prioritized and mapped to executed fixes. [EVIDENCE: code fix set + summaries documented in `implementation-summary.md` and ADR rationale in `decision-record.md`]
- [x] CHK-104 [P1] Rollback notes are updated for stabilized and modularized areas. [EVIDENCE: `decision-record.md` rollback guidance under ADR-003 ("How to roll back")]
- [x] CHK-105 [P1] Final closure report includes changed files and validation result summary. [EVIDENCE: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/implementation-summary.md`]

## P2

P2 items are optional and may be deferred when documented.

<!-- ANCHOR:p2 -->
