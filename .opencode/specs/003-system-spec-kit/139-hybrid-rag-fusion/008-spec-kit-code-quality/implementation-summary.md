## What Was Built

This phase stabilized the baseline first, then delivered a full quality sweep without widening scope beyond safe seams. You can now run the full MCP and script validation lanes with green outcomes, including recovered spec-validator fixture coverage after stricter anchor and template-source enforcement.

### Baseline Stabilization and Contract Repairs

The baseline triad was repaired and held under targeted regression runs. Graph search fallback SQL assertions were made order independent. Query expansion for single-word queries was normalized to the expected contract. Memory index modularization now passes line-budget enforcement in compiled output.

### High-Impact Code Quality Remediation

The review backlog was converted into concrete fixes across handlers, storage, utility paths, and extractor logic. Strict positive-integer parsing now guards checkpoint and delete inputs. Checkpoint restore preserves valid zero values. Retry option normalization was hardened in batch processing. Session and conversation extraction logic was corrected for recency and duplicate observation reuse.

### Moderate Modularization and DRY Extraction

`memory-index.ts` was split along clear seams and now delegates discovery and alias logic through focused modules while preserving MCP envelope behavior. Topic keyword tokenization logic duplicated across script lanes was centralized into a shared helper and consumed by dependent extractors.

### README and Standards Propagation

Repository-owned README coverage under `system-spec-kit` was revalidated and modernized where drift existed. `scripts/ops/README.md` was rewritten to the active `sk-doc` structure and HVR style. High-visibility READMEs were normalized for style drift. Standards propagation guidance now includes explicit `verify_alignment_drift.py` completion-gate steps in both `system-spec-kit` and `sk-code--opencode` skill surfaces.

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed a lock-first sequence: reproduce baseline failures, apply surgical fixes, then broaden to full review and selective modularization only after green checkpoints. Verification ran in layers so regressions were caught early:

1. Targeted MCP regressions for triad and contract-sensitive seams.
2. Full MCP suite and top-level workspace tests.
3. Script validation suites, including extended lanes and phase-system regressions.
4. README validator sweep and phase-folder validation.

When stricter validator rules surfaced fixture drift, fixtures were normalized to match current anchor and template-source contracts instead of downgrading rule severity. This kept the quality bar intact while restoring deterministic test outcomes.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Fix baseline failures before wider refactor | It reduced debugging noise and ensured later diffs were attributable to the new work |
| Keep modularization moderate and seam-based | It improved maintainability without risking API contract drift |
| Normalize fixtures to current validator contract | It preserved hard quality gates and removed false regressions from legacy fixture assumptions |
| Add explicit alignment-verifier completion guidance | It makes future runs consistently enforce `sk-code--opencode` without relying on implicit tribal knowledge |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Quality-lane benchmark dependency** `scripts/tests/test-memory-quality-lane.js` remains environment-dependent because it expects benchmark fixtures under the phase scratch path.
