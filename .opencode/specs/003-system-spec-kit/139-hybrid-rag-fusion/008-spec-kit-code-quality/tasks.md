## Phase Continuity Notice

As of 2026-02-23, `008-spec-kit-code-quality` supersedes `009-spec-kit-code-quality` for all ongoing work in this stream. Continue execution, verification, and documentation updates only in this `008` folder.
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-continuity -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-1 -->
## Phase 1: Baseline Stabilization (Locked Triad)

- [x] T001 Capture baseline triad evidence and failing assertions (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/{graph-search-fn,query-expander,memory-save-extended}.vitest.ts`).
- [x] T002 Fix graph search SQL/lookup contract failure (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/graph-search-fn.ts`).
- [x] T003 Fix query expander single-word variant contract failure (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/query-expander.ts`).
- [x] T004 Resolve modularization gate regression through `memory-index` seam extraction (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-index.ts`).
- [x] T005 Re-run focused triad tests and record pass outputs (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/scratch/`).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-2 -->
## Phase 2: Full Read-Only Review Wave (Max 6 Parallel Lanes)

- [x] T006 Define six-lane bounded-summary schema and lane ownership (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/scratch/`).
- [x] T007 [P] Lane 1 review: search/ranking logic seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/`).
- [x] T008 [P] Lane 2 review: handler and persistence seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/`).
- [x] T009 [P] Lane 3 review: parsing/indexing seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/parsing/`, `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/`).
- [x] T010 [P] Lane 4 review: scripts/validation seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/`).
- [x] T011 [P] Lane 5 review: documentation/README seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/**/README.md`).
- [x] T012 [P] Lane 6 review: test reliability/flaky risk seams (read-only) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/`).
- [x] T013 Consolidate lane findings into prioritized remediation queue and map to requirements (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/tasks.md`).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-3 -->
## Phase 3: Moderate Surgical Modularization

- [x] T014 Extract focused helper modules from `memory-index` hotspot without API break (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-index.ts`).
- [x] T015 Evaluate additional `memory-save` extraction and hold current seam as-is to avoid scope/risk expansion (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-save.ts`).
- [x] T016 Keep handler exports and MCP response contracts unchanged (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/index.ts` and dependent tests).
- [x] T017 Pass modularization gate and related focused regression tests (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/modularization.vitest.ts`).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-3 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-4 -->
## Phase 4: README Modernization (Repo-Owned Only)

- [x] T018 Generate README inventory with enforced exclusions (`node_modules`, `dist`, cache-like directories) (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/`).
- [x] T019 Modernize in-scope READMEs for clarity/consistency in touched areas (`.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/**/README.md`).
- [x] T020 Verify touched README set excludes vendor/generated trees and record manifest (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/scratch/`).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-4 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-5 -->
## Phase 5: `sk-code--opencode` Propagation (Conditional)

- [x] T021 Compare changed implementation patterns against current `sk-code--opencode` references/checklists (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/` and `assets/checklists/`).
- [x] T022 Apply standards propagation updates if net-new enforceable patterns are introduced (`.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/README.md`, `SKILL.md`, selected references).
- [x] T023 Record propagation evidence in phase artifacts (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/checklist.md`).
<!-- /ANCHOR:phase-5 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:phase-6 -->
## Phase 6: Final Verification, Documentation Closure, and Context Save

- [x] T024 Run final command matrix (focused triad, modularization, lint, full suite) and capture evidence (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/scratch/`).
- [x] T025 Validate phase folder docs (`bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .../008-spec-kit-code-quality`).
- [x] T026 Create and populate `implementation-summary.md` after implementation completion (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/implementation-summary.md`).
- [x] T027 Execute memory save script for this phase (`node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality`).
- [x] T028 Prepare concise closure report with files changed and validation results (`.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality/checklist.md`).
