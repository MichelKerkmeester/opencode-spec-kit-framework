# Implementation Plan: Spec Kit Code Quality Completion Run

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript + Node.js + Vitest + Markdown documentation |
| **Framework** | `system-spec-kit` skill workspace with `mcp_server` quality gates |
| **Storage** | Filesystem + SQLite-backed memory index paths in `mcp_server` |
| **Testing** | `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit test` + focused Vitest suites + validation script |

### Overview
The plan executes in five ordered phases: baseline stabilization of the locked failing triad, full read-only review wave coverage, moderate surgical modularization, scoped README modernization plus standards propagation, and final verification/context save. Predecessor phase `007` is treated as complete context; this phase is the quality closure lane.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] Locked decisions captured in spec (`chatgpt` runtime path, max six review lanes, baseline triad must be fixed, moderate modularization depth, README scope boundary).
- [ ] Baseline failing assertions reproducible via focused command set.
- [ ] Review wave lane template and bounded summary schema prepared.

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Baseline triad failures resolved in focused and full reruns.
- [ ] Read-only review wave completed with consolidated findings.
- [ ] Modularization gate and regression checks pass.
- [ ] README modernization limited to repo-owned scope.
- [ ] `sk-code--opencode` propagation completed or no-delta documented.
- [ ] Final verification matrix, spec validation, and context save completed.

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Quality-hardening pipeline with staged stabilization and bounded parallel review orchestration.

### Key Components
- **Baseline Stabilization Lane**: Fixes locked failing assertions before structural edits.
- **Review Wave Orchestrator**: Up to six read-only lanes producing bounded summaries.
- **Moderate Modularization Lane**: Focused extraction in oversized handlers with API stability constraints.
- **Documentation Scope Filter**: README discovery/update rules that exclude vendor/generated trees.
- **Standards Propagation Gate**: Conditional updates to `sk-code--opencode` when net-new patterns are introduced.
- **Verification and Memory Closure Lane**: Full quality command matrix plus `generate-context.js` save.

### Data Flow
1. Reproduce and isolate locked failing triad.
2. Apply targeted fixes and confirm focused pass.
3. Execute six-lane read-only review and rank findings.
4. Apply moderate modularization and constrained README/standards updates.
5. Run final matrix (lint/test/validation), generate completion artifacts, and save context.

## 4. AI EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Task Checklist
- [ ] Confirm modifications stay within approved phase scope.
- [ ] Confirm no file edits occur before relevant source/template reads.
- [ ] Confirm lane concurrency does not exceed six parallel leaf reviews.

### Execution Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Enforcement |
|--------|------|-------------|
| TASK-SEQ-001 | Baseline triad stabilization executes before modularization edits | Prevents refactor masking root-cause failures |
| TASK-SCOPE-002 | README updates limited to repo-owned paths under `system-spec-kit` | Blocks vendor/generated drift |
| TASK-PAR-003 | Read-only review wave uses max six parallel lanes | Preserves bounded synthesis and deterministic closure |
| TASK-STD-004 | `sk-code--opencode` propagation is conditional and evidence-based | Avoids unnecessary standards churn |

### Status Reporting Format
`[PHASE:<id>] [STATE:pending|in_progress|blocked|done] [EVIDENCE:<artifact-or-command>]`

### Blocked Task Protocol
1. Mark task `[B]` with blocking cause and impacted requirement IDs.
2. Capture last successful command/output path.
3. Escalate with options: unblock dependency, narrow scope, or defer with approval.
4. Resume only after blocker disposition is recorded in tasks/checklist.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Baseline Stabilization
- [ ] Reproduce locked failing triad from current baseline.
- [ ] Fix `graph-search-fn`, `query-expander`, and `memory-save-extended` failing assertions.
- [ ] Verify focused reruns for the triad and store evidence outputs.

### Phase 2: Full Read-Only Review Wave
- [ ] Run six-or-fewer read-only lanes with bounded summary format.
- [ ] Consolidate lane outputs into prioritized remediation inventory.
- [ ] Confirm review coverage completeness before structural edits proceed.

### Phase 3: Moderate Surgical Modularization
- [ ] Apply focused extraction to oversized handler seams (`memory-index`, selective `memory-save` sections).
- [ ] Keep existing exported interfaces and response contracts stable.
- [ ] Pass modularization gate and regression reruns.

### Phase 4: README Modernization + Standards Propagation
- [ ] Generate README scope manifest (repo-owned only, exclusions enforced).
- [ ] Modernize in-scope READMEs for clarity and consistency.
- [ ] Apply conditional `sk-code--opencode` propagation updates when deltas are real.

### Phase 5: Final Verification + Context Save
- [ ] Execute full verification command matrix.
- [ ] Validate phase folder and finalize checklist/implementation summary.
- [ ] Save context via `generate-context.js`.

## 6. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Baseline triad reruns | Three locked failing assertions | `vitest run tests/graph-search-fn.vitest.ts tests/query-expander.vitest.ts tests/memory-save-extended.vitest.ts` |
| Modularization gate | Oversized module threshold and structure checks | `vitest run tests/modularization.vitest.ts` |
| Full regression | Workspace-wide quality confirmation | `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit test` |
| Lint gate | MCP server TypeScript linting | `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server run lint` |
| Spec validation | Phase documentation integrity | `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/008-spec-kit-code-quality` |

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 8. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: Regression introduced by targeted fixes, modularization extraction, or scoped documentation updates.
- **Procedure**:
1. Revert phase-local commits in reverse order of phases.
2. Re-run focused failing-test triad to confirm baseline rollback state.
3. Re-run modularization test and lint/test matrix for integrity confirmation.
4. Re-open blocker note with cause and revised mitigation.

## 11. L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Capture pre-change baseline command outputs.
- [ ] Confirm selective file-touch list is available.
- [ ] Confirm no out-of-scope directories are staged.

### Rollback Procedure
1. Revert modularization edits first, then baseline fixes, then docs updates.
2. Run focused triad tests to verify rollback fidelity.
3. Run `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit test` to confirm baseline behavior.
4. Re-document failure cause and updated action plan before reattempt.

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No.
- **Reversal procedure**: N/A (source and docs only).

## 13. L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Baseline triad stabilization** - 2-4 hours - CRITICAL
2. **Read-only review synthesis** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL
3. **Moderate modularization + modularization test pass** - 3-6 hours - CRITICAL
4. **Final verification matrix and context save** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: 7-14 hours

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Review lanes can run in parallel up to six concurrent bounded summaries.
- README modernization prep and standards-delta analysis can overlap after modularization risk is bounded.
