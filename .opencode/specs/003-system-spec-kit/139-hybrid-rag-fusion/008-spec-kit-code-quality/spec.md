# Feature Specification: Spec Kit Code Quality Completion Run

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase `008-spec-kit-code-quality` is the closure hardening phase under parent `139-hybrid-rag-fusion`, following completed predecessor phase `007-spec-kit-templates`. The phase will execute a strict quality run across `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit` and `mcp_server`, with baseline defect stabilization, broad read-only review coverage, bounded modularization, documentation modernization, standards propagation, and final verification/context persistence.

**Key Decisions**: Baseline-first defect stabilization before structural changes; maximum six parallel read-only review lanes with bounded summaries.

**Critical Dependencies**: Stable test harness execution in `mcp_server` and strict README scope filtering to avoid vendor/generated drift.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The quality surface for `system-spec-kit` and `mcp_server` still has blocking failures and maintainability debt that prevent clean closure of the hybrid-rag-fusion program. Current baseline execution shows three canonical failing tests targeted for stabilization (`graph-search-fn`, `query-expander`, `memory-save-extended`) and one additional modularization gate failure tied to oversized handlers that must be addressed through moderate surgical refactor depth.

### Purpose
Deliver a controlled completion run that removes blocking quality debt, hardens maintainability, and leaves a verified, context-preserved baseline ready for follow-on work without reopening unresolved failures.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Stabilize the existing three baseline failing tests through targeted fixes and focused regression reruns.
- Execute a full read-only review wave with at most six parallel lanes and bounded summary outputs.
- Perform moderate surgical modularization in the highest-risk oversized handler paths.
- Modernize README files that are repository-owned under `system-spec-kit` (explicitly excluding vendor/generated trees such as `node_modules`, `dist`, caches).
- Propagate `sk-code--opencode` documentation/standards updates only when implementation introduces net-new enforced patterns.
- Complete final verification matrix and save session context using the official `generate-context.js` workflow.

### Out of Scope
- New product features unrelated to quality hardening.
- Deep architectural rewrite beyond moderate modularization boundaries.
- README edits in vendor/generated directories (`node_modules`, compiled `dist`, caches, temporary outputs).
- Manual memory file authoring under `memory/` (script-only memory save remains mandatory).

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Stable Node/Vitest runtime for `system-spec-kit` workspace | Incomplete verification if runtime breaks | Pin commands to workspace scripts and record command outputs per gate |
| Dependency | Existing test fixtures for deferred DB flows | False negatives/positives if fixtures drift | Keep focused failure reproductions independent of deferred fixture paths |
| Risk | Baseline run reports extra failures beyond locked triad | Scope inflation and delayed closure | Treat locked triad as mandatory stabilization; route additional failures through modularization/review queue with explicit decisions |
| Risk | Over-modularization | Behavioral regression from unnecessary extraction | Enforce moderate-surgical boundary and preserve exported contracts |
| Risk | README modernization creeps into vendor/generated files | Unwanted churn and review noise | Use explicit include/exclude discovery filters and verify touched-path manifest |
| Risk | Standards propagation misses new pattern | Drift between code and `sk-code--opencode` guidance | Add conditional propagation checkpoint before final verification |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Focused failing-test reruns complete in under 3 minutes per cycle.
- **NFR-P02**: Full `mcp_server` test pass remains within normal suite runtime envelope for this repository.

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: No weakening of path traversal/file validation protections in save/index handlers.
- **NFR-S02**: No secrets, tokens, or local machine paths are newly exposed in README/doc updates.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Targeted stabilized failures remain green across at least one focused rerun plus one full-suite rerun.
- **NFR-R02**: Final verification commands are reproducible from documented command matrix entries.

### Maintainability
- **NFR-M01**: Modularization reduces hotspot complexity while retaining existing handler API contracts.
- **NFR-M02**: Documentation updates remain scoped and auditable with clear ownership boundaries.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- README discovery must ignore `node_modules`, `dist`, `.pytest_cache`, and cache-like directories even when nested under valid repo roots.
- Modularization extraction must preserve serialized response shapes consumed by existing integration tests.

### Error Scenarios
- Focused test reruns may pass while full suite fails; both states must be tracked before claiming stabilization.
- Timeout-sensitive `atomicSaveMemory` behavior may fail intermittently under external embedding provider delays.
- SQL path selection in graph search may diverge when FTS table availability probes run before fallback queries.

### State Transitions
- Baseline quality state transitions from "known failing triad + modularization gate debt" to "stabilized baseline + bounded structural cleanup."
- Read-only review findings transition into an explicit fix queue before final closure verification.
