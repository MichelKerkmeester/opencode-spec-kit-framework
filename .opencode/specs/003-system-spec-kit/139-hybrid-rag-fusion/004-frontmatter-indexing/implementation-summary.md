## What Was Built

Frontmatter normalization and indexing completion was delivered for this child spec, including migration execution, idempotency validation, template composition verification, and retrieval quality checks.

### Delivered Output

1. Canonical frontmatter normalization flow validated across template/spec/memory corpora.
2. Migration workflow exercised in apply and dry-run modes, including idempotency verification.
3. Index rebuild completed successfully after migration (ran twice, `STATUS=OK`).
4. Post-reindex data quality checks confirmed no generic `SESSION SUMMARY` leakage in memory rows.

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery and verification evidence captured in this run:

1. Build and template verification:
- `npm run build` (in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit`) passed.
- `scripts/templates/compose.sh` and `scripts/templates/compose.sh --verify` passed.

2. Test execution:
- `node scripts/tests/test-template-system.js` passed.
- `node scripts/tests/test-template-comprehensive.js` passed.
- `node scripts/tests/test-frontmatter-backfill.js` passed, including `T-FMB-008` (template-path coverage by default), `T-FMB-009` (malformed in-block list skip), and `T-FMB-010` (inline-array trailing-comment parsing).
- `npm run test --workspace mcp_server -- tests/memory-parser.vitest.ts tests/memory-parser-extended.vitest.ts tests/spec126-full-spec-doc-indexing.vitest.ts tests/index-refresh.vitest.ts` passed.

3. Migration execution and idempotency:
- Apply pass evidence exists (`scratch/frontmatter-apply-report.json`: `changed 1789`, `failed 0`).
- Final idempotency dry-run passed (`node scripts/dist/memory/backfill-frontmatter.js --dry-run --include-archive`):
  `changed 0 / unchanged 1789 / failed 0`.
- Final dry-run report: `scratch/frontmatter-final-dry-run-report-v3.json`.
- Strict-policy validation dry-run (post-remediation): `scratch/frontmatter-proof-dry-run.json` (`total 1704`, `changed 1623`, `failed 0`, `malformed 0`).

4. Coverage and reindex quality:
- Coverage and parser/index regression tests passed in the executed command set listed above.
- Reindex completed with `STATUS=OK` (ran twice), and legacy invalid-anchor warnings in archived files were non-fatal.
- Expanded fusion audit report: `scratch/full-tree-fusion-audit.md` (commits `111fb30a`, `937f0b06`, `85cc0ce3`) confirms no stale active-spec references outside archive paths.

5. Standards alignment checks:
- `python3 .opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/scripts/verify_alignment_drift.py --root .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/parsing --root .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/lib --root .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory --root .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests --root .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests` passed with `Errors: 0`. Warnings were in unrelated shell utilities, and no findings matched touched frontmatter/indexing files.
- `python3 .opencode/skill/sk-documentation/scripts/extract_structure.py` was run for active 003/004 remediation docs, and all scoped docs reported `style_issues=0` and `content_issues=0` after plan code-fence language tagging.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep archived-file invalid-anchor warnings as non-blocking | Reindex status was OK and warnings were legacy archive-only, not active migration failures. |
| Treat idempotency as release gate | `changed: 0` on final dry-run confirms deterministic reruns before completion claim. |
| Record deferred controls in checklist instead of forcing assumptions | Preserves strict evidence standard for unresolved controls. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Implementation completed | PASS - build, compose verification, migration, and reindex execution completed |
| Verification evidence captured | PASS - commands, reports, and DB quality metrics documented with concrete values |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Open non-functional controls remain** Some checklist controls (for example monitoring/alerting coverage, normalization/rebuild runbook items, formal security/compliance reviews, performance budget/latency evidence, and final sign-off items) remain deferred and are explicitly tracked in `checklist.md`.
2. **Legacy archive warnings still present** Reindex warnings for invalid anchors in archived files are non-fatal but not remediated in this scope.
