# Verification Checklist: 004-frontmatter-indexing

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md | Evidence: `spec.md` exists and contains scoped requirements for `004-frontmatter-indexing`.
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md | Evidence: `plan.md` exists and defines migration/reindex approach for this child spec.
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available | Evidence: `npm run build` passed in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:code-quality -->
## Code Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Parser and migration code pass lint/format checks | Evidence: `npm run typecheck` passed in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit`.
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No runtime warnings in migration + reindex commands | Evidence: Reindex reached `STATUS=OK`. Observed warnings were legacy anchor-content warnings in archived docs and were non-fatal (operational caveat recorded).
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] Error handling implemented for malformed frontmatter | Evidence: `node scripts/tests/test-frontmatter-backfill.js` and `node scripts/tests/test-template-comprehensive.js` passed.
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Changes follow system-spec-kit patterns | Evidence: `scripts/templates/compose.sh` and `scripts/templates/compose.sh --verify` passed.
<!-- /ANCHOR:code-quality -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
## Testing

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Acceptance criteria met for normalization and rebuild | Evidence: Migration dry-run and regression command set passed, and reindex reached `STATUS=OK` (ran twice).
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Manual dry-run and apply verification complete | Evidence: `scratch/frontmatter-apply-report.json` (`changed: 1789, failed: 0`) plus idempotency dry-run `scratch/frontmatter-final-dry-run-report-v3.json` (`changed: 0, unchanged: 1789, failed: 0`).
- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Edge cases tested (managed key casing, quoted comma arrays, malformed frontmatter) | Evidence: `node scripts/tests/test-frontmatter-backfill.js` passed with `T-FMB-005`, `T-FMB-006`, `T-FMB-007`, `T-FMB-009`, and `T-FMB-010`.
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Retrieval regression scenarios validated | Evidence: `npm run test --workspace mcp_server -- tests/spec126-full-spec-doc-indexing.vitest.ts tests/index-refresh.vitest.ts` passed. Prior DB quality checks remain recorded in implementation summary.
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
## Security

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] No hardcoded secrets added by migration tooling | Evidence: Secret scan over changed system-spec-kit files found no matches for `(API_KEY|SECRET|TOKEN|PASSWORD|BEGIN PRIVATE KEY|VOYAGE_API_KEY)`.
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Input validation implemented for frontmatter parser | Evidence: `npm run test --workspace mcp_server -- tests/memory-parser.vitest.ts` passed, and `test-frontmatter-backfill.js` now asserts malformed frontmatter skip/no-rewrite behavior (`T-FMB-007`, `T-FMB-009`).
- [x] CHK-032 [P1] File write scope constrained to intended directories | Evidence: `scratch/frontmatter-final-dry-run-report-v3.json` lists rewrite roots only under `.opencode/specs` and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/.opencode/specs`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation

- [x] CHK-040 [P1] spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md are synchronized | Evidence: Tracking docs were updated in this completion pass.
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Decision rationale recorded in decision-record.md | Evidence: `decision-record.md` includes ADR-001 with context, alternatives, and consequences.
- [x] CHK-042 [P2] README notes updated if command behavior changes | Evidence: strict malformed-frontmatter behavior and `--allow-malformed` are documented in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md` and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory/README.md`.
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Temp files in scratch/ only | Evidence: Migration/test artifacts are under `scratch/` (for example `scratch/frontmatter-final-dry-run-report-v3.json`).
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion | Evidence: Deferred with scope approval from the remediation plan instruction dated 2026-02-22, which preserves audit artifacts in `scratch/` for proof retention.
- [ ] CHK-052 [P2] Findings saved to memory/ | Deferred: No `memory/` context-save artifact was recorded in provided evidence.
