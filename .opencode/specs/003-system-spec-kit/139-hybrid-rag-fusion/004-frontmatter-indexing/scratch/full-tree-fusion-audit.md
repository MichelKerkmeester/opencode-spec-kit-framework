## Body Drift Sample (frontmatter-stripped)
- Representative files checked: 3
- Files with body differences: 2

### Body-drift sample files
- .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md (body changed in commit sample)
- .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/memory/README.md (body changed in commit sample)
- .opencode/specs/001-anobel.com/z_archive/003-btn-download-alignment/plan.md (frontmatter-only in commit sample)

## Notes
- This audit enforces structural invariants across the commit-derived markdown set.
- Body drift is sampled from files changed in commit 111fb30a where both parent and commit blobs exist.
- Full corpus body equivalence is not enforced for archive/history migrations.
