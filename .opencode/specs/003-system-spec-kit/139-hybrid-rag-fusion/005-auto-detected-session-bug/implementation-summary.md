## What Was Built

Session selection finalization is complete for this spec. Regression tests and command guidance now capture and enforce the intended behavior: prefer active non-archived specs, handle `specs/` vs `.opencode/specs/` deterministically, remain resilient to mtime distortion, and require safe behavior when confidence is low.

### Delivered Behavior and Evidence

Detector logic was confirmed active with no additional code delta required in this pass. The implementation is present in both source and dist artifacts, and existing command guidance was verified as aligned with user-facing behavior.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-folder-detector-functional.js` | Modified | Adds and validates detector regression coverage for the bug acceptance dimensions. |
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/resume.md` | Verified alignment (no net diff in this pass) | Existing resume command guidance aligns with deterministic session selection expectations. |
| `.opencode/command/spec_kit/handover.md` | Verified alignment (no net diff in this pass) | Existing handover command guidance aligns with session selection behavior. |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec-folder/folder-detector.ts` | Verified active (no net diff) | Confirms detector implementation already present and in use for target behavior. |
| `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/spec-folder/folder-detector.js` | Verified active (no net diff) | Confirms runtime-distributed detector artifact matches active behavior. |

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery completed through targeted regression and command-guidance verification, then validated by execution and review gates:
- Functional test command: `node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-folder-detector-functional.js`
- Result: `32 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped`
- Review gate: PASS, score `88/100`, no P0/P1 findings

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Accept no-net-diff detector finalization | Source and dist detector implementations were already active; forcing redundant edits would create noise without behavioral gain. |
| Use tests and docs as completion evidence | The changed artifact in this pass was regression testing coverage, while command guidance alignment was verified with no net diff. |
| Keep scope locked to session auto-detection bug | Prevents unrelated refactoring and preserves confidence in completion evidence. |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Functional detector regression suite | PASS (`node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-folder-detector-functional.js` -> 32 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped) |
| Review gate | PASS (score 88/100, no P0/P1 findings) |
| Detector implementation presence | PASS (verified active in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec-folder/folder-detector.ts` and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/spec-folder/folder-detector.js`; no net diff required) |
| Spec validator for this folder | PASS (`bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/005-auto-detected-session-bug`) |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **P2 deferred memory save** Memory snapshot generation was intentionally deferred because this pass explicitly disallowed memory loading/saving.
2. **Residual audit risk** Future detector refactors could reintroduce mtime-heavy ranking bias if regression coverage is not maintained.
