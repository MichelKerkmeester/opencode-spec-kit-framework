# Session Handover: 005-auto-detected-session-bug

CONTINUATION - Attempt 1 | Spec: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/005-auto-detected-session-bug` | Last: confirmed wrong session detection behavior | Next: create Level 2 docs, then implement fix

## 1. Session Summary

- **Date**: 2026-02-22
- **Session Type**: bug triage + handover bootstrap
- **Primary Objective**: create a dedicated continuation path for fixing auto-detected spec selection errors
- **Progress Estimate**: 20% (analysis and handover only)

### Key Accomplishments
- Confirmed the previous auto-detection result was wrong for current user intent.
- Captured authoritative user-provided recent context folders:
  - `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion`
  - `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/004-frontmatter-indexing`
- Established this dedicated bug folder for follow-up execution.
- Recorded validation baseline and blockers in a continuation-ready format.

### Detailed Problem Statement

The current session auto-detection path can route to an incorrect, stale, or irrelevant spec folder even when there is clear recent activity in active work folders. In this case, detection selected an archived path (`specs/001-anobel.com/z_archive/001-finsweet-performance`) while the real active context was in:

- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion`
- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/004-frontmatter-indexing`

This is a high-impact workflow failure because downstream commands (`/spec_kit:handover`, `/spec_kit:resume`, memory save/index operations, and validation routines) can run against the wrong spec context and produce misleading outputs.

Observed failure dimensions:

- **Source mismatch risk**: detection can prefer `specs/` paths while active work is under `.opencode/specs/`.
- **Archive contamination risk**: `z_archive` and fixture/test paths can be treated like live sessions.
- **Recency distortion risk**: broad indexing/touch operations can make mtime-only ranking unreliable.
- **Confidence gap risk**: wrong auto-detection can be accepted without a strong confidence guardrail.

Required fix outcome:

- Detection prioritizes active, non-archived, non-test spec folders.
- `.opencode/specs` and `specs` aliasing is handled deterministically.
- Low-confidence detection triggers explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
- Selection rationale is visible enough to debug why a folder was chosen.

Implementation precondition (user-mandated): create full **SpecKit Level 2 documentation** in this folder before any code changes.

## 2. Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | RESEARCH / PLANNING (pre-implementation) |
| Active File | `handover.md` |
| Last Action | Validated folder and documented prerequisites |
| System State | Folder exists but has no spec documentation files yet |

## 3. Completed Work

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Identified and acknowledged auto-detection mismatch against user intent.
- [x] Validated folder state with spec validator.
- [x] Captured required follow-up direction from user in a dedicated handover.

### Evidence Captured
- [x] Validation output indicates missing baseline docs (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`).
- [x] User instruction captured: place second handover here and define Level 2 prerequisite.

### What Is Not Done Yet
- [ ] No implementation code exists for detection ranking/filter logic.
- [ ] No regression tests exist for this bug yet.
- [ ] No Level 2 spec documents exist in this folder yet.

## 4. Pending Work

### Immediate Next Action
> **MANDATORY FIRST STEP:** create **SpecKit Level 2 documentation** in this folder before implementation starts.

### Remaining Tasks (Priority Order)
- [ ] [P0] Initialize Level 2 docs: `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, `implementation-summary.md`.
- [ ] [P0] Define acceptance criteria for correct session auto-detection (exclude stale/archive/test fixtures by default).
- [ ] [P0] Implement deterministic recency scoring that is resilient to bulk re-index mtime churn.
- [ ] [P1] Add regression tests for detection ranking with mixed live/archive/test fixture folders.
- [ ] [P1] Add user-facing confirmation behavior when confidence is low.
- [ ] [P2] Add diagnostics output showing why a folder was selected.

## 5. Key Decisions

### Decision A
- **Choice**: Split this bug into its own continuation folder and handover.
- **Rationale**: keeps remediation focused and avoids polluting unrelated in-flight specs.
- **Alternatives Rejected**: folding this into existing hybrid-rag or frontmatter specs.

### Decision B
- **Choice**: Treat Level 2 docs as a hard prerequisite before coding.
- **Rationale**: user explicitly requested structured planning-first workflow for this bug.
- **Alternatives Rejected**: immediate code patch without scoped spec/checklist baseline.

## 6. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- **Documentation blocker**: folder currently fails validation due missing core spec files.
- **Context blocker**: no local memory snapshots in this folder yet.

### Risks
- Auto-detection may keep selecting stale or fixture paths if filtering is not explicit.
- Bulk indexing operations can skew mtime-based heuristics and produce misleading recency signals.
- False confidence may route users into the wrong spec context without clear confirmation.

### Mitigation
- Enforce Level 2 documentation first.
- Add explicit exclusion rules (`z_archive`, `test-suite`, fixture paths) with override option.
- Require confirmation prompt when confidence falls below threshold.

## 7. Continuation Instructions

### To Resume
```bash
/spec_kit:resume .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/005-auto-detected-session-bug
```

### Required First Move
1. Create Level 2 spec documentation in this folder.
2. Re-run validation until no P0/P1 blockers remain.
3. Only then start implementation and tests.

### Files to Review First
1. `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_handover_full.yaml` - workflow behavior and setup requirements.
2. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh` - current validation gates.
3. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/handover.md` - related context from adjacent remediation.

### Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Initialize Level 2 docs in this folder.
- [ ] Add initial bug statement + acceptance criteria.
- [ ] Define and approve detection strategy before coding.
- [ ] Implement and verify regression tests.
