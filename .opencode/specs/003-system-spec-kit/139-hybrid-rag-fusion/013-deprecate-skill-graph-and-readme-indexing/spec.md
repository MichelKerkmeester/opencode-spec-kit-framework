# Feature Specification: 013 - Deprecate Skill Graph and README/Skill-Ref Indexing (Completion Pass 2)

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This completion pass finalizes deprecation of skill graph and README/skill-reference indexing behavior across memory MCP, commands, skills, and agents. It closes residual cleanup in create workflows, MCP naming/descriptor residue, and README table-of-contents anchor gaps, then captures completion-grade verification evidence.

**Key Decisions**: fully remove SGQS and skill-ref/readme-indexing surfaces; keep causal graph retrieval features and related controls intact.

**Critical Dependencies**: synchronized updates in `.opencode/command`, `.opencode/skill`, `.opencode/agent`, and `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server` with passing compile/test gates.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

Phase 012 removed most SGQS/readme-indexing functionality, but completion artifacts still needed a final pass that verified all residual references were gone and that adjacent cleanup changes were captured. Without this pass, release documentation and verification records stayed incomplete for a broad, cross-cutting deprecation.

### Purpose

Provide completion-grade closure for deprecating skill graph + README/skill-ref/workflows-code asset indexing features, with explicit evidence that in-scope code/docs are clean and validated.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

- Finalize and document removal of SGQS/skill-graph/readme-indexing/skill-ref indexing references in memory MCP sources.
- Capture command cleanup completion:
  - `graph_node` asset type removed from create skill-asset workflows.
  - README auto-indexing notes removed from create-folder-readme auto/confirm YAML.
- Confirm and document missing README table-of-contents anchor additions in:
  - `.opencode/skill/mcp-chrome-devtools/README.md`
  - `.opencode/skill/sk-documentation/README.md`
  - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/addendum/README.md`
- Capture MCP residual cleanup:
  - `SkillGraphLike` renamed to `MemoryGraphLike`.
  - stale README descriptor line corrected.
- Capture rebuild/restoration completion for MCP runtime test assets:
  - `mcp_server/dist/database`
  - `mcp_server/dist/configs/search-weights.json`

### Coverage Targets

- `.opencode/command/**`
- `.opencode/skill/**`
- `.opencode/agent/**`
- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/**`

### Out of Scope

- New retrieval features outside deprecation/cleanup scope.
- Any behavior changes to causal graph retrieval and related controls.
- Editing files outside this `013` spec folder for documentation artifacts.

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | Residual references remain in less-traveled docs/scripts | Medium | Multi-pattern `rg` sweeps over declared coverage targets |
| Risk | Deprecation may accidentally remove causal graph behavior | High | Explicit ADR boundary and targeted naming checks (`MemoryGraphLike`) |
| Dependency | mcp_server build/test determinism | Medium | Record compile and full-suite test evidence with command output summary |
| Dependency | Dist/runtime asset presence for tests | Medium | Verify `dist/database` and `dist/configs/search-weights.json` paths |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Reliability

- **NFR-R01**: Deprecation completion must not regress core MCP compile/test stability.

### Maintainability

- **NFR-M01**: Deprecated contract surface is removed from docs and code references to avoid operator confusion.

### Operability

- **NFR-O01**: Verification commands and file evidence are reproducible from documented paths.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Behavior Boundaries

- Causal graph features (causal edges, causal boosting/routing) remain supported and are not part of this deprecation.
- Existing historical spec/memory text may still mention SGQS in archived context and is not runtime behavior.

### Environment Edge Cases

- Test behavior can vary with embedding-provider env; completion evidence captures a stable passing full-suite run.

## 9. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Triggers |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Scope | 23/25 | Cross-cutting cleanup across command/skill/agent/mcp_server surfaces |

| Research | 15/20 | Multiple residual sweeps and evidence capture |
| Multi-Agent | 7/15 | Single execution path, broad artifacts |
| Coordination | 12/15 | Sync between code cleanup status and completion docs |
| **Total** | **77/100** | **Level 3** |

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Cleanup Completion Proof (Priority: P0)

**As a** maintainer, **I want** final deprecation evidence documented, **so that** the phase can be closed without ambiguity.

### US-002: Contract Clarity (Priority: P0)

**As an** operator, **I want** removed SGQS/readme-indexing surfaces gone from active docs and source, **so that** prompts and tooling do not reference dead capabilities.

### US-003: Safe Boundary Retention (Priority: P1)

**As a** platform owner, **I want** causal graph features explicitly retained, **so that** deprecation does not remove intended retrieval behavior.
