## What Was Built

This pass closes the deprecation work with evidence-backed documentation. You now have a complete Level 3 artifact set proving that SGQS/readme-indexing/skill-ref surfaces are removed across the declared coverage targets, with compile/test and policy-scan evidence captured in one place.

### Completion Evidence Bundle

The phase records three verification pillars: build health (`npx tsc`), full regression health (`npm test`), and forbidden-term policy sweeps for mcp_server and create command assets. The artifact set also captures residual cleanup (command YAML cleanup, README TOC anchors, MCP naming residue) that was completed after the main deprecation pass.

### Boundary Safety

The decision record makes the boundary explicit: deprecation removes SGQS/readme-indexing/skill-ref/workflows asset indexing features, while causal graph functionality remains supported. This prevents over-removal and keeps behavior aligned with intent.

### Legacy Skill-Graph Consolidation

`013` is now the single active skill-graph-related folder in `138-hybrid-rag-fusion`. Legacy folders `002`, `003`, `006`, `007`, `009`, and `012` were consolidated through merge documentation and archived intact under `../z_archive/skill-graph-legacy/`.

The merge index is documented in `merge-manifest.md`, which records:
- source folders and archive destinations
- preserved artifact categories (spec/plan/tasks/checklist/decision/summary plus auxiliary docs)
- active-state rule preventing duplicate active skill-graph folders

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed a strict closure sequence: gather evidence first, then author all Level 3 artifacts, then validate the spec folder. Verification included compile success, a full passing Vitest run, and clean `rg` sweeps for forbidden terms.

One earlier default-environment test run showed a timeout in `tests/memory-save-extended.vitest.ts`; the stabilized full-suite pass used `unset VOYAGE_API_KEY && npm test` and produced the expected final status (`155` files passed, `0` failed, `19` skipped).

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Require evidence-backed closure instead of implicit closure | Cross-cutting deprecations need auditable proof to avoid stale surface claims |
| Preserve causal graph behavior while removing SGQS/readme-indexing/skill-ref surfaces | Scope required deprecation without breaking supported retrieval behavior |
| Keep dist runtime assets restored | Tests depend on these assets, so reproducible verification requires them |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Environment variability**: default environment can trigger provider-related timing differences; use the documented stable test command for reproducible closure evidence.
2. **Historical archives**: prior archived memory/spec artifacts may still mention deprecated terms; this pass validates active target surfaces only.

<!-- ANCHOR:next-steps -->
## Next Steps

1. Treat this `013` child phase as complete and ready for parent phase roll-up.
2. Use `merge-manifest.md` as the canonical bridge to archived legacy skill-graph folders.
3. Keep the forbidden-term scans as a regression guard in future deprecation-related work.
