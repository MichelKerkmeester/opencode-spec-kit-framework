# Session Handover: 003-index-tier-anomalies

CONTINUATION - Attempt 1 | Spec: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies` | Last: retroactive scans + validation alignment | Next: runtime verification and cleanup

## 1. Session Summary

- **Date**: 2026-02-22
- **Session Type**: remediation + verification
- **Primary Objective**: finish retroactive memory-title remediation and prepare reliable continuation state
- **Progress Estimate**: 85%

### Key Accomplishments
- Completed broad retroactive `memory_index_scan(force=true)` coverage across major spec namespaces.
- Confirmed generic `SESSION SUMMARY` title issue is remediated for newly indexed parent records.
- Reproduced remaining runtime symptom: chunk-heavy list output still appears in live `memory_list` checks.
- Validated this spec folder and fixed `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` pre-check failures for core docs.
- Created structured handover for controlled resume without losing context.

## 2. Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | REVIEW / HANDOVER |
| Active Area | MCP memory indexing and list behavior |
| Last Action | Re-validated target spec folder and prepared continuation package |
| System State | Workspace is dirty due broad spec-folder renumber/move operations plus prior remediation edits |

## 3. Completed Work

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Ran forced indexing passes for `003-system-spec-kit`, `000-ai-systems-non-dev`, `001-anobel.com`, `002-commands-and-skills`, and `004-agents`.
- [x] Captured and handled repeated `E429` cooldown windows during indexing.
- [x] Re-ran validation on this spec and cleared template-source hard errors.
- [x] Preserved user constraint: no nested agent dispatch from this command workflow.

### Files Modified in This Step
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/spec.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/plan.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/tasks.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/checklist.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/decision-record.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)
- [x] `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/implementation-summary.md` (frontmatter template-source marker)

### Verification Executed
- [x] `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies` -> PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] Memory query checks confirm descriptive titles now dominate reindexed records.

## 4. Pending Work

### Immediate Next Action
> Restart/reload the Spec Kit MCP server runtime, then re-test `memory_list(includeChunks=false)` to confirm chunk rows are filtered out as expected.

### Remaining Tasks (Priority Order)
- [ ] [P0] Verify live runtime picks up latest handler/schema changes for `includeChunks`.
- [ ] [P0] Re-run list checks on representative folders and confirm parent-only output.
- [ ] [P1] Execute final global sanity search for remaining generic-title regressions.
- [ ] [P1] Reconcile `.opencode/specs` vs `specs` path duplication effects in active workflows.
- [ ] [P2] Optional: add one integration test for live list behavior parity assumptions.

## 5. Key Decisions

### Decision A
- **Choice**: Use MCP memory tools only for indexing/verification.
- **Rationale**: Align with project constraints and avoid direct DB mutations.
- **Alternatives Rejected**: direct sqlite/sql shell workflows.

### Decision B
- **Choice**: Treat runtime chunk-list symptom as a deployment/runtime state issue, not a parser-title issue.
- **Rationale**: source-level fixes and tests exist; live behavior mismatch indicates stale runtime or environment drift.
- **Alternatives Rejected**: reworking parser logic again before runtime reload confirmation.

## 6. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- **Runtime mismatch**: live server behavior does not yet reflect expected list filtering.
- **Workspace churn**: large unrelated delete/untracked changes increase review noise.

### Risks
- **False-positive remediation closure** if runtime is not restarted before final validation.
- **Path-alias regressions** if `.opencode/specs` and `specs` continue to coexist without strict canonicalization in all flows.

### Mitigation
- Restart MCP runtime before final claim.
- Keep verification commands scoped and logged.
- Avoid touching unrelated dirty files during completion.

## 7. Continuation Instructions

### To Resume
```bash
/spec_kit:resume .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies
```

### Files to Review First
1. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-list.ts` - list filtering behavior (`includeChunks`).
2. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tool-schemas.ts` - API schema/runtime wiring.
3. `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/memory-crud-extended.vitest.ts` - expected list behavior.
4. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/003-index-tier-anomalies/checklist.md` - verification status baseline.

### Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Confirm MCP server process restart/reload status.
- [ ] Run focused `memory_list` checks with and without `includeChunks`.
- [ ] Re-run one `memory_search` sanity query for generic titles.
- [ ] Update checklist/handover with final verification evidence.
