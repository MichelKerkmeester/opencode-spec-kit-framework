# Implementation Summary

## Metadata

| **Spec Folder** | 005-frontmatter-indexing |
| **Completed** | Not completed yet |
| **Level** | 3 |

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

This file has been initialized for Level 3 compliance before implementation begins. It currently records intended outcome only, not completed delivery artifacts.

### Planned Output

The implementation will normalize frontmatter across templates, spec docs, and memory markdown, then rebuild indexes from canonical metadata. You should expect deterministic migration behavior, clearer parser boundaries, and explicit reindex verification evidence.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Implementation has not started in this child spec yet. Delivery details will be updated after parser, migration, and reindex tasks execute with test evidence.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Initialize summary early with explicit not-started state | Keeps required Level 3 artifact present without implying completion. |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Implementation completed | NOT RUN - pending execution |
| Verification evidence captured | NOT RUN - pending execution |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **No execution evidence yet** This file is pre-populated for structure only and must be updated after implementation.
