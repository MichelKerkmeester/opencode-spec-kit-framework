# Supplemental Summary: Command Alignment Outcomes

## Summary

This document captures command-alignment outcomes that are now part of `002-hybrid-rag-fusion`.

## Merged Outcomes

- Command authoring flows were aligned to graph-aware and hybrid retrieval behavior.
- Memory command documentation reflects a three-channel retrieval model (vector + BM25 + graph).
- Feature-flag documentation for graph controls is synchronized with the system skill documentation.
- Auto/confirm command asset pairs were aligned to maintain equivalent behavior.

## Validation Notes

- Verification evidence from the originating alignment track was preserved through this consolidation.
- No runtime API contracts were changed by this merge.
