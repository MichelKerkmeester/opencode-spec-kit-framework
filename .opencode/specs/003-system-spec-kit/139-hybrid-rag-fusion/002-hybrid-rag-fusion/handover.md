# Session Handover: 138-hybrid-rag-fusion (Unified Context Engine)

**CONTINUATION - Attempt 2**
**Spec Folder**: specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours

---

## 1. Session Summary

**Objective**: Review the Level 3+ spec folder for quality and completeness, fix all identified issues, and create comprehensive test coverage for every new feature defined in spec 138.
**Progress**: 100% (Review + Fixes + Test Coverage Complete)

### Key Accomplishments
- Conducted full spec folder review scoring 93/100 (EXCELLENT) with 0 P0 blockers, 0 P1 required, 10 P2 suggestions.
- Fixed all 10 P2 issues: priority labels in checklist.md, line-ref anchors in tasks.md, scratch repo cleanup (~15MB), latency budget consistency, and 5 memory file metadata corrections (context_type, memory_classification, ellipsis paths, truncated decision titles).
- Updated spec docs (tasks.md, plan.md, checklist.md) with Phase 5 testing requirements before writing any tests.
- Created 7 new test files (70 tests) and updated 11 existing test files (+41 tests) = 111 new tests total.
- Final test suite: 149 files, 4,526 tests passed, 19 skipped, 0 failures.

## 4. Pending Work

### Immediate Next Action
> Begin Phase 0 Implementation: Activate dormant assets in `lib/search/hybrid-search.ts` — set `useGraph: true`, wire `hybridAdaptiveFuse(intent)`, inject `spreadActivation()`, implement two-pass fallback.

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Phase 0: Activate disconnected existing assets (Graph channel, co-activation, fallback) (Low effort)
- [ ] Phase 1: Implement Cosine MMR and TRM Evidence Gap checks (Medium effort) -- depends on Phase 0
- [ ] Phase 2: Native FTS5 multi-field `bm25` weights and edge-multiplier CTEs (Low effort) -- depends on Phase 1
- [ ] Phase 3: Template-based synonym query expansion for `mode="deep"` (Medium effort) -- depends on Phase 2
- [ ] Phase 4: Indexing quality updates (`remark-gfm` chunking, Batch PageRank) (High effort) -- depends on Phase 3
- [ ] Move test stubs to real implementations as each phase is implemented

### Dependencies
- All test files currently contain inline stub implementations (functions defined in the test files themselves). When implementing each phase, the real modules must be created and tests updated to import from the actual source files.

---

## 5. Key Decisions

### Test-First Strategy with Inline Stubs
- **Choice**: Write all 111 tests with inline implementations in the test files before any production code is written.
- **Rationale**: Validates the algorithm logic and expected behavior upfront. When real modules are created, tests simply change their import paths.
- **Impact**: All tests are green now; production implementation has a complete behavioral specification to code against.

### Phase 5 as Parallel Track
- **Choice**: Test coverage runs alongside each implementation phase rather than being deferred to the end.
- **Rationale**: Prevents test debt accumulation and ensures regression guards are in place before feature flags are flipped.
- **Impact**: Added 22 tasks to tasks.md, 22 items to checklist.md, strategy section to plan.md.

### All P2 Issues Fixed (No Deferrals)
- **Choice**: Fixed all 10 P2 suggestions from the review rather than deferring any.
- **Rationale**: P2 items were quick fixes (metadata corrections, label additions, path cleanups) that improve spec quality with minimal effort.
- **Impact**: Memory files now have correct classification metadata; checklist has consistent priority labeling.

## 6. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None.

### Risks
- Test stubs use simplified algorithms (e.g., MMR without real embedding vectors, PageRank on in-memory graphs). Real implementations may surface edge cases not covered by stubs.
- The 120ms latency ceiling in integration tests is verified against mock pipeline stages. Real I/O (SQLite queries, disk access) may require threshold adjustments.

## 7. Continuation Instructions

### To Resume
```
/spec_kit:resume specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion
```

### Files to Review First
1. `specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion/tasks.md` -- Phase 0 tasks for immediate implementation
2. `specs/003-system-spec-kit/139-hybrid-rag-fusion/002-hybrid-rag-fusion/checklist.md` -- Phase 0 + Phase 5 validation criteria
3. `mcp_server/tests/integration-138-pipeline.vitest.ts` -- End-to-end behavioral spec for the full pipeline

### Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Load this handover document
- [ ] Review Phase 0 tasks in tasks.md
- [ ] Check existing test stubs in `mcp_server/tests/` for behavioral expectations
- [ ] Execute: Begin Phase 0 -- Activate `useGraph: true`, wire `hybridAdaptiveFuse(intent)`, inject `spreadActivation()`, implement two-pass fallback in `lib/search/hybrid-search.ts`
- [ ] After Phase 0 implementation, update test imports from inline stubs to real module paths

### Context to Load
- `memory/20-02-26_11-54__hybrid-rag-fusion.md` -- Most recent memory (test coverage session)
- `decision-record.md` -- D1-D5 architectural decisions
- `plan.md` -- Phase 0-5 execution strategy with Dark Launching runbook
