# Implementation Plan: Spec Kit Code Quality Initiative

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Shell, Python, Markdown |
| **Framework** | OpenCode skill workflow for `system-spec-kit` and `mcp_server` |
| **Storage** | Filesystem, SQLite-backed memory/index operations in `mcp_server` |
| **Testing** | Vitest, npm workspace scripts, spec validation scripts |

### Overview
This plan executes a review-first quality workflow that covers all in-scope code and docs. It identifies hotspot files, applies bounded KISS+DRY refactors, performs README modernization using latest workflow template and HVR standards, and completes standards propagation in `sk-code--opencode` where evidence shows it is needed. The phase closes only after verification commands and spec validation pass.

## 2. QUALITY GATES

### Definition of Ready
- [ ] Scope boundary confirmed: `system-spec-kit` + `mcp_server` + conditional `sk-code--opencode` updates.
- [ ] Review matrix prepared for all in-scope directories.
- [ ] Baseline verification commands run and captured.
- [ ] Hotspot criteria defined (size, complexity, duplication, churn).

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Full in-scope review completed with findings severity labels.
- [ ] KISS+DRY hotspot refactors completed and verified.
- [ ] README modernization completed for all in-scope READMEs.
- [ ] `sk-code--opencode` artifacts updated or no-delta documented.
- [ ] Verification matrix passes.
- [ ] Phase folder validation succeeds.

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Staged quality-hardening pipeline with review-first discovery, bounded refactor implementation, and verification closure.

### Key Components
- **Coverage Review Matrix**: Ensures every in-scope directory is reviewed using `sk-code--review` criteria.
- **Hotspot Ranking Engine (manual rubric)**: Scores bloated scripts/modules for KISS+DRY refactor priority.
- **Refactor Workstream**: Applies minimal-risk modular splits and deduplication.
- **README Modernization Workstream**: Updates in-scope READMEs to latest workflow template and HVR standards.
- **Standards Propagation Gate**: Syncs `sk-code--opencode` with newly enforced patterns.
- **Verification Gate**: Runs targeted and full-suite checks and validates spec documentation.

### Data Flow
1. Establish baseline and coverage matrix.
2. Execute full code review sweep and hotspot ranking.
3. Implement prioritized KISS+DRY refactors in bounded batches.
4. Apply README and standards updates.
5. Run verification matrix and spec validation.
6. Publish closure evidence and blockers/deferred list.

## 4. AI EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Task Checklist
- [ ] Read target files before any modifications.
- [ ] Confirm each edit maps to a requirement ID.
- [ ] Keep scope lock: no unrelated cleanup.

### Execution Rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Enforcement |
|--------|------|-------------|
| TASK-SEQ-001 | Complete full review pass before broad refactors | Prevents changing code before understanding hotspots |
| TASK-SCOPE-002 | Keep edits inside approved paths only | Avoids scope creep and hidden regressions |
| TASK-KISS-003 | Prefer smallest refactor that removes duplication/complexity | Enforces KISS+DRY without over-engineering |
| TASK-DOC-004 | README updates must follow latest workflow template + HVR | Maintains doc consistency |
| TASK-STD-005 | Update `sk-code--opencode` artifacts only with evidence-backed deltas | Avoids unnecessary standards churn |

### Status Reporting Format
`[PHASE:<id>] [STATE:pending|in_progress|blocked|done] [REQ:<id>] [EVIDENCE:<artifact-or-command>]`

### Blocked Task Protocol
1. Mark blocked task as `[B]` in `tasks.md` with blocker reason.
2. Record impacted requirement IDs and candidate workaround.
3. Continue non-blocked tasks when safe.
4. Re-verify dependent tasks after unblock.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 5. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Baseline and Review Matrix Setup
- [ ] Capture current command baseline for tests/lint/validation.
- [ ] Build directory-level review matrix for all in-scope code surfaces.
- [ ] Define hotspot scoring rubric for bloated files.

### Phase 2: Full-Scope Code Review
- [ ] Review `mcp_server` handlers/libs/tests with `sk-code--review` lenses.
- [ ] Review root `system-spec-kit` scripts (`ts/sh/py/js/mjs`) for complexity and duplication.
- [ ] Produce prioritized hotspot list and remediation recommendations.

### Phase 3: KISS+DRY Refactor Planning and Execution
- [ ] Select top hotspot candidates with the lowest-risk/highest-impact ratio.
- [ ] Implement bounded modular splits and deduplication.
- [ ] Run targeted verification for each refactor batch.

### Phase 4: README Modernization and HVR Alignment
- [ ] Inventory all in-scope README files.
- [ ] Apply latest workflows-documentation template structure.
- [ ] Normalize voice and clarity to HVR standards.

### Phase 5: Standards Propagation (`sk-code--opencode`)
- [ ] Compare implemented patterns against current standards artifacts.
- [ ] Update `SKILL.md`, references, assets, index, and nodes where needed.
- [ ] Record no-delta rationale if no standards changes are required.

### Phase 6: Final Verification and Documentation Closure
- [ ] Run full command matrix.
- [ ] Resolve or explicitly defer remaining P1/P2 findings.
- [ ] Validate phase folder and finalize checklist evidence state.

## 6. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Baseline snapshot | Current state before refactors | npm scripts + vitest |
| Targeted regression | Touched modules/scripts per batch | vitest targeted runs |
| Integration/full | End-to-end `system-spec-kit` test suite | `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit test` |
| Lint/style | `mcp_server` and related script quality gates | `npm --prefix .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server run lint` |
| Spec validation | Phase documentation integrity | `bash .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh <folder>` |

## 7. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| `mcp_server` test environment | Internal | Available | Cannot verify refactor safety |
| `system-spec-kit` script runtime | Internal | Available | Hotspot validation cannot be executed |
| README template/HVR guidance | Internal | Available | Documentation modernization may drift |
| `sk-code--opencode` artifact ownership | Internal | Available | Standards propagation cannot complete |
| Spec validation scripts | Internal | Available | Completion claim cannot be validated |

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 8. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: New regressions, broken contracts, or failing verification gates after refactor/documentation updates.
- **Procedure**:
1. Revert latest refactor batch.
2. Re-run targeted checks for reverted scope.
3. Re-run full matrix if regression impact was broad.
4. Re-open hotspot item with revised plan.

## 13. L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Review matrix and full sweep** - 4-7 hours - CRITICAL
2. **Refactor implementation and targeted retests** - 4-8 hours - CRITICAL
3. **Standards/docs alignment + final verification** - 3-5 hours - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: 11-20 hours

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- README/HVR modernization can run in parallel with late refactor batches once ownership boundaries are fixed.
- Standards draft updates can begin while final refactor verification is in progress.
