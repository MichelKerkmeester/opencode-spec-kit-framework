## What Was Built

This phase closed concrete quality and reliability gaps in the Spec Kit runtime without broad refactor churn. You can now rely on stricter path containment for spec-folder operations, truthful checkpoint semantics in MCP delete and restore flows, and a clean README standards baseline with explicit propagation into `sk-code--opencode`.

### Path Hardening Across Spec Scripts and Shared Utilities

Path safety was tightened in every high-risk filesystem mutation path. `scripts/spec/archive.sh` now resolves canonical directories, enforces boundary-safe containment checks, validates `NNN-name` folder format, and refuses archive or restore operations outside approved roots. `scripts/spec/create.sh` now resolves and validates `--subfolder` and `--parent` against `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` only, with canonical path checks before folder creation.

Shared path logic in `scripts/utils/path-utils.ts` was hardened to canonicalize real paths, validate allowed-base containment with relative path boundaries, and reject null-byte and traversal-prone input. `scripts/setup/check-prerequisites.sh` now escapes JSON output values so machine-readable mode remains valid when paths or values include special characters.

### MCP Reliability and Checkpoint Truthfulness

Checkpoint handlers now return accurate MCP envelope outcomes for failure states. `mcp_server/handlers/checkpoints.ts` returns structured MCP errors when checkpoint creation fails and when restore reports errors, instead of surfacing success on failed restore scenarios. Restore logic also runs the index/cache refresh sequence after successful restore payloads so search state stays aligned.

Delete flows now emit rollback guidance only when checkpoint creation actually succeeded. `mcp_server/handlers/memory-bulk-delete.ts` enforces mandatory checkpoint behavior for high-safety tiers and blocks unsafe `skipCheckpoint` combinations. `mcp_server/handlers/memory-crud-delete.ts` keeps delete behavior truthful by attaching restore instructions only when a checkpoint exists.

Hybrid search filtering now supports both `contextType` and `context_type` rows in `mcp_server/handlers/memory-search.ts`, which fixes missed matches from snake_case sources. `mcp_server/lib/storage/transaction-manager.ts` now includes a Node 18-safe recursive directory fallback when scanning pending files, removing runtime fragility tied to recursive `readdirSync` support differences.

### README Audit Closure and Standards Propagation

README modernization validation completed cleanly across in-scope files. The audit reported `94` in-scope READMEs, `94` template-valid, `0` template-invalid, `0` warnings, and `0` broken references. This confirmed no in-scope README drift remained after the phase audit.

Standards propagation updates were applied in `sk-code--opencode` artifacts to reflect enforced safeguards from this phase: `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/SKILL.md`, `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/references/shared/universal_patterns.md`, and `.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode/assets/checklists/universal_checklist.md`.

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed a review-first, bounded-refactor sequence. First, hotspot findings were consolidated and ranked from in-scope review output. Next, path and MCP reliability fixes were implemented in focused clusters with immediate targeted verification after each batch. Finally, documentation and standards gates were closed with a repo-wide README audit and standards propagation pass.

Verification evidence was captured as reproducible commands in `scratch/verification-log.md`, with non-gating failures documented explicitly instead of hidden. Final phase closure included spec validation for this exact phase folder.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Canonical-path containment checks were required for archive/create path mutations | Substring checks were not sufficient for traversal and symlink boundary safety |
| Checkpoint handlers return MCP error envelopes on create/restore failures | Tool consumers need truthful response state to avoid unsafe follow-up operations |
| Delete handlers only emit restore guidance when checkpoint creation succeeds | Rollback instructions are misleading and unsafe without a real checkpoint |
| Standards propagation was applied to `sk-code--opencode` artifacts in the same phase | Enforced patterns should be codified immediately so future reviews stay aligned |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Pre-existing script-module expectation drift** `scripts/tests/test-scripts-modules.js` still fails on symbols outside this phase diff, so it remains documented as non-gating.
2. **Optional benchmarking remains deferred** No benchmark table was required in this phase (`CHK-313` deferred), because changes focused on safety and correctness rather than performance tuning.
