# Global Quality Sweep Protocol: 006-hybrid-rag-fusion-logic-improvements

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: governance-extension | v1.0 (006-local) -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:purpose -->
## Purpose and Scope

This document defines the mandatory closure protocol that must execute before any completion claim for `006-hybrid-rag-fusion-logic-improvements`.

Protocol coverage is global and includes every implemented update and new feature delivered under this spec folder.
<!-- /ANCHOR:purpose -->

<!-- ANCHOR:mandatory-closure -->
## Mandatory Closure Protocol

### 1) Global Testing Round (Required)

- Execute one consolidated testing round across all implemented updates and new features.
- Include retrieval/fusion, graph/causal contracts, cognitive scoring, session flows, CRUD re-embed consistency, parser/index invariants, storage recovery, telemetry governance, and operational automation paths.
- Record every command and result in the evidence table (`ANCHOR:evidence-table`).

### 2) Global Bug Detection Sweep (Required)

- Execute a full defect sweep across all changed behavior and integration seams.
- Log all discovered defects with severity, owner, and closure state.
- Completion claim is blocked unless unresolved defect count is:
  - `P0 = 0`
  - `P1 = 0`

### 3) `sk-code--opencode` Compliance Audit (Required)

- Audit all changed/added code paths for `sk-code--opencode` alignment (style, safety, maintainability, and workflow conformance).
- Publish audit evidence and outcome in this file.
- If non-compliance is found, resolution actions must be completed or explicitly accepted with rationale before closure.

### 4) Conditional Standards Update Pathway (Conditional)

- Trigger this pathway only if architecture or implementation evidence indicates a standards mismatch that cannot be resolved by code/document changes alone.
- If triggered:
  - Update `sk-code--opencode` with explicit rationale and evidence.
  - Document the mismatch, change intent, and resulting standards delta in this file.
- If not triggered:
  - Mark as `N/A` with explicit rationale and supporting evidence reference.

## Closure Gate

Completion claim for this spec is permitted only when all conditions below are true and they are all satisfied as of `2026-02-22`:

- [x] Global testing round completed with published evidence (`EVT-001`).
- [x] Global bug detection sweep completed with zero unresolved `P0` and `P1` defects (`EVT-002`, closure counts `P0=0`, `P1=0`).
- [x] `sk-code--opencode` compliance audit completed with evidence (`EVT-003`).
- Conditional standards update pathway is either:
  - [ ] Completed with documented change evidence, or
  - [x] Marked `N/A` with explicit rationale and evidence (`EVT-004`, no architecture mismatch detected).

**Closure Gate Decision**: SATISFIED (all required protocol steps closed; unresolved defects `P0=0`, `P1=0`).
