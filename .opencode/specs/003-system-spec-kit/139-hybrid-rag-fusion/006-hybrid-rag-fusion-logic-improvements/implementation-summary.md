## What Was Built

Implementation delivery is closed for the broadened ten-subsystem hardening scope. The implementation and verification pass covered retrieval/fusion guardrails, graph/causal and cognitive scoring contracts, session/state integrity hardening, telemetry schema + documentation drift enforcement, mutation-ledger/recovery behavior, and runbook drill automation across all four failure classes.

### Delivered Outcomes

- Retrieval/search pipeline quality gates passed via full MCP-server lint + test sweep and targeted changed-area tests.
- Telemetry alignment validation passed (`6/6`) for schema/documentation drift checks.
- Operational runbook drills passed in both success and escalation scenarios across all required classes (`index-drift`, `session-ambiguity`, `ledger-mismatch`, `telemetry-drift`).
- Global defect closure reached unresolved counts `P0=0` and `P1=0`.
- Spec governance artifacts were synchronized to final completion state (tasks/checklist/global-quality-sweep/implementation summary + status sync).

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

Delivery used the existing Level 3+ spec workflow and consolidated verification evidence from final quality artifacts. Closure evidence came from one final quality bundle (`scratch/final-quality-evidence-2026-02-22.md`) plus prior global sweep support artifacts (`scratch/w5-global-quality-evidence.md`, `scratch/w6-baseline-metrics-sweep.md`). These were encoded into closure docs and sign-off state dated `2026-02-22`.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Broaden scope to ten subsystem domains | Research identified critical risks beyond retrieval/fusion internals |
| Add requirement -> phase -> task traceability matrix | Ensures every scope addition is implementable and verifiable |
| Keep approval/sign-off model aligned across spec and checklist | Prevents governance drift at closure time |
| Close completion state only after command-backed evidence | Prevents unsupported closure claims and keeps audit trail concrete |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `npm run lint` (mcp_server) | PASS |
| `npm test` (mcp_server) | PASS (`Test Files 155 passed`; `Tests 4570 passed | 19 skipped`) |
| Targeted changed-area tests (`handler-memory-index`, `mutation-ledger`, `retrieval-telemetry`, `retrieval-trace`) | PASS (`84` tests) |
| Alignment validator test script | PASS (`6/6`) |
| Runbook success drill (all classes) | PASS (`RECOVERY_COMPLETE` for 4 classes) |
| Runbook escalate drill (all classes) | PASS expected-failure path (exit `1`, `ESCALATIONS=4`) |
| Defect closure status | PASS (`P0=0`, `P1=0`) |

## Completion Criteria Status

1. All checklist P0 items: satisfied and marked complete with evidence references.
2. P1 items: satisfied, including conditional-path `N/A` rationales where applicable.
3. Broadened regression coverage: satisfied via full + targeted test evidence.
4. Performance/recovery/automation evidence: satisfied with final and sweep artifacts.
5. Telemetry schema and doc drift validation: satisfied (`6/6` alignment tests pass).
6. Self-healing drills: satisfied for all four required failure classes.
7. Sign-off model: synchronized to approved statuses dated `2026-02-22`.
8. Governance closure: satisfied via `global-quality-sweep.md` with closure gate marked SATISFIED.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. A transient timing flake was observed once in `tests/envelope.vitest.ts` (`latencyMs >= 30` measured `29ms`), then cleared on immediate isolated rerun and subsequent full-suite rerun.
2. `w6` notes partial benchmark script availability; unavailable metrics are explicitly documented in `scratch/w6-baseline-metrics-sweep.md` and treated as non-blocking for this closure package.
3. Conditional standards update pathway remained `N/A` because no architecture mismatch was detected in final evidence.
