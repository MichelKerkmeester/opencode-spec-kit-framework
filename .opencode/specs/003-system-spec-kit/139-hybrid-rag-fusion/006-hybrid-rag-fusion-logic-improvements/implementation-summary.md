## What Was Built

This file is pre-filled as a baseline for later completion updates. The current pass delivered full Level 3+ planning and governance documentation for the hybrid RAG fusion logic improvements initiative. No production code changes were performed in this documentation task.

### Baseline Artifacts Created

- `spec.md` with deep audit objectives, continuity mapping from `002` to `005`, and Level 3+ governance sections.
- `plan.md` with phased implementation model, dependency graph, and communication/escalation rules.
- `tasks.md` with actionable tasks including dependencies and acceptance criteria matrices.
- `checklist.md` with baseline verification state and pending implementation gates.
- `decision-record.md` with ADRs for audit-first delivery, unified confidence policy, and prevention-first release gates.

### Files Changed

This section is intentionally omitted for Level 3+ completion narrative style. Final implementation update should describe delivered behavior impact rather than file inventory.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The current delivery used a template-driven Level 3+ documentation workflow. Inputs were gathered from prior child specs (`002`, `003`, `004`, `005`) and translated into carry-forward assumptions, controls, and implementation phases for `006`. Validation and checklist initialization were prepared so future implementation evidence can be appended without restructuring the documents.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Keep this summary in baseline state until implementation evidence exists | Prevents premature completion claims and preserves audit integrity |
| Use continuity mapping from `002` to `005` as explicit section content | Ensures this spec builds on prior work rather than restarting assumptions |
| Pre-allocate completion criteria in this file | Makes final update objective and evidence-driven |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Level 3+ documentation set created in target folder | PASS |
| Continuity mapping from `002`/`003`/`004`/`005` included in spec and plan | PASS |
| Checklist initialized with baseline status and pending gates | PASS |
| Production code changes executed in this pass | NONE (expected for documentation-only scope) |

## Completion Criteria for Final Update

The final implementation summary update can move to completed state only when all criteria below are satisfied:

1. All P0 checklist items are marked complete with concrete evidence.
2. P1 items are complete or explicitly deferred with approval.
3. Regression matrix includes and passes failure classes from `003`, `004`, and `005`.
4. Performance and reliability evidence is recorded for post-hardening behavior.
5. Approval workflow entries in `spec.md` and checklist sign-off are updated to approved states.
6. Final narrative explains user-visible and operator-visible impact, including limitations and follow-up items.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. No implementation evidence exists yet because this pass is documentation-only.
2. Benchmark values and operational metrics are pending future execution phases.
3. Sign-off records remain pending until implementation and verification complete.
