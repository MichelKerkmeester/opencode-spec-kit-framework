## What Was Built

This file is pre-filled as a baseline for later completion updates. The current pass delivered synchronized Level 3+ documentation updates that broaden 006 scope from retrieval/fusion-only hardening to ten coordinated subsystem areas discovered during research.

### Baseline Artifacts Created

- `spec.md` updated with explicit ten-area scope, measurable requirements, continuity expansion, and requirement -> phase -> task traceability.
- `plan.md` updated with five implementation phases covering ranking contracts, state integrity, telemetry governance, operational automation, and closure gates.
- `tasks.md` updated with concrete dependency-linked tasks and measurable acceptance matrices for each subsystem area.
- `checklist.md` updated with verification gates for graph contracts, cognitive/FSRS integration, session-learning quality, CRUD re-embedding consistency, parser/index health automation, storage recovery/ledger consistency, telemetry schema/doc drift, deferred path closure, and self-healing runbooks.
- `decision-record.md` updated with ADR set for broadened scope, state-integrity-first controls, telemetry governance, and prevention-first operational closure.

### Files Changed

This section is intentionally omitted for Level 3+ completion narrative style. Final implementation update should describe delivered behavior impact across the ten scoped subsystems rather than file inventory.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The current delivery used template-aligned Level 3+ documentation maintenance in the existing `006` spec folder. Inputs were carried forward from `002`, `003`, `004`, and `005`, then expanded into explicit controls for all research-discovered risk systems. The outcome is a synchronized planning/governance baseline with measurable thresholds and consistent sign-off model, ready for implementation execution.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Broaden scope to ten subsystem domains | Research identified critical risks beyond retrieval/fusion internals |
| Add requirement -> phase -> task traceability matrix | Ensures every scope addition is implementable and verifiable |
| Keep approval/sign-off model aligned across spec and checklist | Prevents governance drift at closure time |
| Keep summary in baseline state until implementation evidence exists | Prevents premature completion claims and preserves audit integrity |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Level 3+ documentation set updated in target folder | PASS |
| Ten-subsystem broadened scope reflected in spec/plan/tasks/checklist/decision record | PASS |
| Continuity mapping from `002`/`003`/`004`/`005` expanded and synchronized | PASS |
| Requirement-to-phase-to-task mapping documented | PASS |
| Production code changes executed in this pass | NONE (expected for documentation-only scope) |

## Completion Criteria for Final Update

The final implementation summary update can move to completed state only when all criteria below are satisfied:

1. All P0 checklist items are marked complete with concrete evidence.
2. P1 items are complete or explicitly deferred with approval and rationale.
3. Regression matrix includes and passes broadened subsystem coverage, including deferred/skipped paths from `002`/`003`/`004`/`005`.
4. Performance, recovery, and automation evidence is recorded against defined thresholds.
5. Telemetry schema validation and documentation drift checks are passing.
6. Self-healing runbook drills are completed for all required failure classes.
7. Approval workflow and sign-off tables are updated to approved states across technical, engineering, QA, operations, and product roles.
8. Final narrative explains user-visible and operator-visible impact, limitations, and follow-up actions.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. No implementation evidence exists yet because this pass is documentation-only.
2. Benchmark, recovery, and operational drill metrics are pending implementation phases.
3. Sign-off records remain pending until implementation and verification complete.
4. Final threshold tuning may still adjust within documented acceptance bounds during execution.
