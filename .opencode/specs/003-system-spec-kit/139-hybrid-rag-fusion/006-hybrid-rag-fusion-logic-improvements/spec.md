## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This initiative hardens the active Hybrid RAG stack across the full operational surface, not only retrieval/fusion internals. The delivery now spans ten integrated subsystems: retrieval/fusion, graph/causal contracts, cognitive ranking (attention-decay and FSRS), session manager and session-learning quality, memory CRUD re-embedding consistency, parser/indexing invariants with automated index health, storage reliability (transaction recovery and mutation ledger consistency), telemetry/trace schema governance with docs drift prevention, deferred/skipped-path test hardening, and self-healing automation runbooks.

The objective remains continuity-first: keep the architecture from `002` and convert high-risk seams identified through `003`, `004`, and `005` into measurable controls with release gates.

**Key Decisions**: retain SQLite-first tri-hybrid architecture; apply audit-first execution; extend hardening scope to all discovered risk-bearing subsystems; require traceable requirement -> phase -> task -> checklist mapping.

**Critical Dependencies**: stable MCP search/index contracts, regression harnesses from `002` through `005`, deterministic canonicalization behavior, mutation ledger integrity, and schema-governed telemetry events.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
Hybrid retrieval capabilities are active, but systemic risk remains at cross-module seams. Existing hardening is concentrated on fusion quality and confidence thresholds while other coupled systems still permit silent drift: graph relation scores can diverge from ranking expectations, cognitive decay signals may be inconsistently applied, session-learning can route stale context, memory CRUD can leave stale embeddings, parser/index invariants can degrade without automatic repair, transaction/mutation consistency can fail under interruption, telemetry schemas can drift from docs, deferred test paths can remain unverified, and operational checks can remain reactive instead of self-healing.

### Purpose
Deliver a broadened deep-audit and hardening pass that makes the complete retrieval-to-operations chain measurable, deterministic, and resilient so retrieval quality, context routing, data integrity, and run-time governance remain trustworthy under production pressure.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
1. Retrieval/fusion pipeline hardening (parse -> index -> gather -> fusion -> fallback -> response metadata).
2. Graph/causal channel contracts and relation-scoring calibration.
3. Cognitive ranking integration: attention-decay and FSRS-aware score modulation.
4. Session manager and session-learning pipeline quality/performance upgrades.
5. Memory CRUD and metadata re-embedding consistency controls.
6. Parser/indexing invariants plus index-health automation checks.
7. Storage reliability: transaction recovery and mutation-ledger consistency.
8. Telemetry/trace schema governance and documentation drift prevention.
9. Test coverage hardening for deferred/skipped paths and prior-spec regressions.
10. Automation loops and operational runbooks for self-healing checks.

### Out of Scope
- Migration to external vector, graph, or search databases.
- Large schema redesign of the existing SQLite memory schema.
- UI changes or non-MCP client feature work.
- Broad refactors not tied to audit findings or required subsystem controls above.

## 3.5 PRIOR-WORK CONTINUITY (002/003/004/005)

### Carry-Forward Assumptions
- **From `002-hybrid-rag-fusion`**: tri-hybrid retrieval (vector + FTS/BM25 + graph), MMR, and evidence-gap signaling remain architectural baseline.
- **From `003-index-tier-anomalies`**: canonical-path dedup and deterministic tier precedence remain mandatory invariants.
- **From `004-frontmatter-indexing`**: normalized frontmatter and idempotent reindex behavior remain required preconditions.
- **From `005-auto-detected-session-bug`**: confidence-aware session/folder detection and archive exclusion remain mandatory for workflow safety.

### Carry-Forward Expansion Matrix in `006`

| Prior Spec | Preserved Outcome | Expanded in 006 |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `002-hybrid-rag-fusion` | Tri-hybrid + fusion + evidence-gap baseline | Adds graph-contract scoring, cognitive decay integration, and telemetry-governed ranking diagnostics |
| `003-index-tier-anomalies` | Canonical path + tier invariants | Adds index-health automation, CRUD re-embed consistency, and ledger-backed integrity checks |
| `004-frontmatter-indexing` | Normalized metadata and idempotent reindex | Adds parser/index auto-heal checks, schema drift prevention, and re-embedding consistency gates |
| `005-auto-detected-session-bug` | Confidence-aware routing safeguards | Adds session-learning quality metrics, routing/retrieval confidence alignment, and operational runbook coverage |

### Carry-Forward Gaps Addressed in `006`
- Convert deferred operational controls into enforced release checks across all ten scoped subsystems.
- Add cross-system drift detection linking ranking quality, storage integrity, and telemetry/documentation consistency.
- Harden regression boundaries so canonicalization, session confidence, and mutation consistency issues cannot silently recur.

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Existing hybrid-search scoring contracts | Incorrect assumptions can break ranking semantics | Capture and lock baseline fixtures before tuning; compare deterministically post-change |
| Dependency | Parser/index normalization guarantees from `003` and `004` | Drift in metadata contract weakens ranking and retrieval confidence | Add invariant gates and auto-heal probes for parser/index paths |
| Dependency | Session confidence mechanics from `005` | Session-learning quality can regress routing behavior | Align routing/retrieval confidence policy and add ambiguity boundary tests |
| Risk | Overweighting cognitive modifiers | False precision in ranking and unstable output | Bound FSRS/decay contribution to 5-25% and enforce ablation regression checks |
| Risk | Re-embedding backlog under high mutation volume | Stale embeddings degrade retrieval quality | Add queue SLA checks and reconciliation loop with alert thresholds |
| Risk | Transaction recovery logic adds hidden complexity | Inconsistent data on interruption | Add recovery simulation suite and ledger replay assertions before release |
| Risk | Telemetry schema drift vs documentation | Operators lose diagnostic reliability | Enforce schema registry validation and docs drift gate |
| Risk | Expanded scope causes timeline pressure | Delivery quality drops or partial controls ship | Require phased completion gates and explicit deferral protocol |

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Retrieval p95 remains <= 120ms for `mode="auto"` and <= 180ms for `mode="deep"` on baseline corpus.
- **NFR-P02**: Session selection p95 remains <= 250ms for 500 candidates; session-learning batch reconciliation p95 <= 400ms.
- **NFR-P03**: Health automation loop runtime remains <= 5 minutes per full sweep.

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: Path normalization and folder detection safeguards continue blocking traversal and unapproved roots.
- **NFR-S02**: Trace payloads exclude sensitive content and validate against allowed schema fields only.
- **NFR-S03**: Mutation ledger integrity checks detect tampering or out-of-order replay.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Same query and same index state yield deterministic ranking output.
- **NFR-R02**: Reindex + retrieval + session routing workflows remain idempotent across reruns.
- **NFR-R03**: Recovery drills achieve RPO 0 for committed mutations and documented RTO <= 10 minutes.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty or near-empty retrieval sets still emit deterministic confidence and trace metadata.
- High-cardinality graph neighborhoods are bounded before expensive relation-score fanout executes.
- Large mutation bursts do not leave stale embedding backlog after reconciliation SLA window.

### Error Scenarios
- Index anomaly during search emits safe fallback metadata and triggers health loop escalation.
- Session ambiguity with near-equal confidence scores triggers explicit confirmation or safe deterministic fallback.
- Interrupted write transaction triggers replay-recovery path and ledger consistency validation before marking success.
- Trace schema mismatch blocks release and reports doc/schema field diffs.

### Cross-System Consistency
- Canonical path aliases (`specs/` vs `.opencode/specs/`) remain unified across scan, index, search, and session detection.
- Tier precedence and frontmatter normalization remain consistent from parser output through ranking inputs.
- Telemetry field names and docs references remain synchronized by automated drift checks.

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Deterministic Hybrid Retrieval with Causal and Cognitive Signals (Priority: P0)

**As a** retrieval maintainer, **I want** fusion, graph relation scoring, and cognitive decay signals to be consistent and bounded, **so that** ranking quality improves without nondeterministic behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given fixed fixture queries, when retrieval executes repeatedly, then ranked outputs and metadata are deterministic.
2. Given long-tail recall fixtures, when cognitive modifiers are enabled, then NDCG@5 improves while primary-fixture regression remains bounded.

---

### US-002: Trustworthy Session and Memory State Integrity (Priority: P0)

**As a** platform owner, **I want** session routing, session-learning, CRUD re-embedding, parser/index invariants, and storage recovery to be synchronized, **so that** context state remains reliable under mutation and interruption.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given ambiguous sessions, when selection runs, then low-confidence handling is explicit and misroutes stay <= 1%.
2. Given write interruptions, when recovery runs, then committed mutations are preserved and replay remains consistent.

---

### US-003: Governance and Observability That Stay in Sync (Priority: P0)

**As an** operations lead, **I want** telemetry schema validation and docs drift prevention tied to release gates, **so that** diagnostics remain accurate and actionable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given trace emission changes, when CI runs, then schema/doc mismatches fail fast.
2. Given production-like diagnostics, when debugging incidents, then per-channel/routing rationale is available.

---

### US-004: Prevention Controls That Cover Known and Deferred Paths (Priority: P1)

**As a** QA lead, **I want** deferred/skipped path coverage and self-healing runbooks to be explicit and test-backed, **so that** regressions are blocked and remediation is repeatable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given deferred test inventory, when hardening completes, then each path is tested or approved with explicit owner.
2. Given known failure classes, when self-healing checks run, then remediation flow is documented and validated.
