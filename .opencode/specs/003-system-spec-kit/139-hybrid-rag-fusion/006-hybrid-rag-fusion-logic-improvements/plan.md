# Implementation Plan: 006-hybrid-rag-fusion-logic-improvements

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core | v2.2 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript (Node.js), Markdown spec tooling |
| **Framework** | system-spec-kit MCP server + command scripts |
| **Storage** | SQLite + markdown-based spec and memory artifacts |
| **Testing** | Vitest, script-level functional tests, spec validation scripts |

### Overview
This plan now covers all risk-bearing systems discovered in research, not only retrieval/fusion internals. Delivery runs in five phases: cross-system audit, ranking/channel hardening, state-integrity hardening, telemetry/operations governance, and verification/sign-off closure. The plan preserves architecture decisions from `002` and converts fragile seams from `003`, `004`, and `005` into measured controls and release gates.

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Audit-first, contract-driven hardening with release-gated invariants and self-healing operations.

### Key Components
- **Cross-System Audit Orchestrator**: maps subsystem contracts, captures baselines, and ranks seam risks.
- **Ranking and Contract Guardrails**: retrieval/fusion determinism, graph relation contract checks, and cognitive modifier bounds.
- **Session/State Integrity Layer**: session manager quality controls, session-learning hygiene, CRUD re-embedding consistency, parser/index invariants, and storage recovery checks.
- **Telemetry Governance Layer**: trace schema registry, payload validation, and docs drift enforcement.
- **Prevention and Operations Layer**: deferred/skipped-path test hardening and self-healing runbooks.

### Data Flow
1. Capture baseline metrics and continuity constraints for all ten subsystem areas.
2. Apply ranking/channel hardening (fusion, graph, cognitive) with deterministic contracts.
3. Apply session/state-integrity controls (routing quality, learning hygiene, CRUD re-embed, parser/index health, storage recovery).
4. Govern diagnostics through telemetry schema validation and docs drift checks.
5. Run prevention, recovery, and operational self-heal drills before sign-off.

## 3.5 CARRY-FORWARD IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (002/003/004/005)

| Prior Spec | Carry-Forward Asset | 006 Usage |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `002-hybrid-rag-fusion` | Tri-hybrid retrieval + MMR/TRM pipeline | Baseline for retrieval/fusion determinism and channel governance |
| `003-index-tier-anomalies` | Canonical path dedup + tier precedence | Elevated to parser/index + storage integrity gates |
| `004-frontmatter-indexing` | Frontmatter normalization + idempotent reindex | Enforced as parser/index invariant and metadata consistency precondition |
| `005-auto-detected-session-bug` | Confidence-aware folder/session detection | Extended into session manager and session-learning quality/performance controls |

| Expanded Area | Primary Continuity Source | Implementation Note |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Graph/causal relation scoring | `002` | Contract tests and relation score calibration are now mandatory release-gated checks |
| Cognitive decay + FSRS ranking | `002` + `005` | Confidence/ranking alignment requires bounded cognitive weighting and ablation checks |
| CRUD re-embed consistency | `003` + `004` | Canonical metadata and index consistency now include mutation-to-embedding SLA controls |
| Storage recovery + mutation ledger | `003` | Index integrity now extends to transactional recovery parity and replay consistency |
| Telemetry/docs drift governance | `004` + `005` | Diagnostic schema changes require matching docs updates and gate validation |

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Baseline fixtures for retrieval/session/storage/telemetry paths | Internal | Green | Hardening cannot be validated against real behavior |
| Parser/index normalization guarantees from `003` and `004` | Internal | Green | State-integrity controls can produce false positives |
| Session confidence hooks from `005` | Internal | Green | Routing/retrieval policy alignment is incomplete |
| Mutation ledger + transaction recovery hooks | Internal | Yellow | Storage reliability criteria cannot be proven |
| CI support for schema-gate and self-healing verification | Internal | Yellow | Prevention controls cannot be release-enforced |

Status criteria:
- `Green`: validated in the current branch with passing evidence available.
- `Yellow`: dependency is identified, but one or more validation artifacts are still pending.
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: sustained latency regression, elevated session misroute rate, re-embedding backlog growth, recovery replay mismatch, or telemetry-schema gate failures.
- **Procedure**: roll back by phase in reverse critical-path order while preserving audit baselines and replay fixtures; restore previous thresholds/contracts; rerun critical regression + recovery suites before reattempt.

<!-- ANCHOR:enhanced-rollback -->
## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Baseline audit fixtures archived for retrieval, session, and storage paths
- [ ] Threshold and contract deltas documented with before/after metrics
- [ ] Recovery replay artifacts captured and verifiable
- [ ] Emergency gate override protocol documented with approver list

### Rollback Procedure
1. Disable newly introduced gates only when verified false positives are documented.
2. Revert phase-specific changes in reverse order (Phase 5 -> Phase 2).
3. Restore prior stable thresholds/contracts from archived baseline artifacts.
4. Re-run deterministic regression, recovery replay, and telemetry schema checks.
5. Record incident details and decision-record updates before redeployment.

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No direct schema migrations expected
- **Reversal procedure**: restore previous index snapshots and mutation-ledger checkpoint, then replay validated transaction set to confirm parity

## L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Cross-system baselines and continuity lock complete** - 1.5 days - CRITICAL
2. **Ranking/channel hardening stabilized** - 2 days - CRITICAL
3. **Session/state integrity controls validated** - 2 days - CRITICAL
4. **Telemetry/ops governance checks operational** - 1.5 days - CRITICAL
5. **Verification/recovery/sign-off closure** - 1 day - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: ~8 days

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Telemetry schema authoring can start during Phase 3 once diagnostic contracts stabilize.
- Runbook drafting can proceed in parallel with verification fixture expansion.
- Documentation evidence updates can run concurrently with Phase 5 gate execution.

<!-- /ANCHOR:milestones -->

## L3: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

### ADR-001: Broad cross-system hardening over retrieval-only tuning

**Status**: Accepted

**Context**: Research identified high-risk seams outside retrieval/fusion. Limiting work to ranking internals would leave unresolved state-integrity and operational failure modes.

**Decision**: Execute full ten-subsystem hardening with explicit requirement mapping and release gates.

**Consequences**:
- Positive: failure prevention is systemic rather than local.
- Negative: implementation complexity and verification scope increase.

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Retrieval/fusion-only plan: rejected because it does not cover discovered systemic risks.

## L3+: AI EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Tier 1: Sequential Foundation
**Files**: `spec.md` sections 1-5 + continuity and traceability mappings
**Duration**: one focused pass
**Agent**: Primary

### Tier 2: Controlled Parallel Preparation
| Agent | Focus | Files |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Primary (single-owner) | Plan + tasks synchronization | `plan.md`, `tasks.md` |
| Primary (single-owner) | Checklist + governance synchronization | `checklist.md`, `decision-record.md`, `implementation-summary.md` |

**Execution Rule**: Workflow runs in one LEAF execution context; no nested dispatch is used.

### Tier 3: Integration
**Agent**: Primary
**Task**: Validate requirement-to-task mapping, sign-off consistency, and gate readiness across all docs
**Duration**: final verification pass

<!-- ANCHOR:communication -->
## L3+: COMMUNICATION PLAN

### Checkpoints
- **Daily**: status updates in `tasks.md` and blockers in `checklist.md`.
- **Per Phase**: milestone review with continuity and risk register updates.
- **Operational Drill**: runbook simulation summary at end of Phase 4.
- **Blockers**: immediate escalation with command-level evidence.

### Escalation Path
1. Technical blocker -> Engineering Lead
2. Verification failure -> QA Lead
3. Operational readiness blocker -> Operations Lead
4. Scope or timeline risk -> Product Owner

---

## AI EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Task Checklist
- Confirm target files, tests, and subsystem focus for active phase.
- Confirm continuity constraints from `002/003/004/005` remain valid.
- Confirm no schema migration and no out-of-scope refactor.

### Execution Rules
| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Scope | Edit only planned files for the current phase. |
| Verification | Run mapped tests/checks before claiming completion. |
| Evidence | Record concrete command/file evidence for completed P0/P1 items. |

### Status Reporting Format
- `STATE`: current checkpoint.
- `ACTIONS`: files edited and commands executed.
- `RESULT`: pass/fail plus next action.

### Blocked Task Protocol
1. Stop edits for the blocked area and capture error evidence.
2. Attempt one bounded workaround that does not expand scope.
3. Escalate with impact and options if unresolved.
