## What Was Built

This update delivered a docs-only policy enforcement pass for SpecKit artifacts. You now have a complete Level 2 documentation set in `007-spec-kit-templates`, and the previously identified non-research standard artifacts in `039`, `040`, and `041` no longer include ToC sections.

<!-- ANCHOR:how-delivered -->
## How It Was Delivered

The work was delivered in three steps: template-aligned doc creation in the new spec folder, targeted ToC block removal in scoped non-research artifacts, and validation using policy scans plus `validate.sh` across all requested folders.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Limit retro cleanup to standard artifact filenames only | Matches requested scope and avoids unrelated README/archive edits |
| Preserve `research.md` and subtree exclusions (`memory/`, `scratch/`, `context/`) | Enforces explicit policy boundaries |
| Use minimal ToC block removal pattern | Prevents content churn outside policy target |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| ToC policy scan on scoped standard artifacts | PASS (no remaining ToC headings detected) |
| `validate.sh` on `007-spec-kit-templates` | PASS WITH WARNINGS (exit 1; missing recommended acceptance scenarios and checklist `P0`/`P1` sections) |
| `validate.sh` on `039-sk-code-opencode-alignment-hardening` | FAIL (exit 2; `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` header missing reported across 6 files) |
| `validate.sh` on `040-sk-visual-explainer-hardening` | FAIL (exit 2; `TEMPLATE_SOURCE` header missing reported across parent and phase docs; phase-link warning also present) |
| `validate.sh` on `041-code-review-skill` | PASS |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. **Scope-limited cleanup** README and archive documentation files that contain ToC were intentionally left unchanged because they are outside this request.
2. **Pre-existing validation debt remains** `039` and `040` have template-source/phase-link validation issues outside the requested ToC-removal scope.
3. **No memory save in this pass** Context persistence was not requested for this task.
