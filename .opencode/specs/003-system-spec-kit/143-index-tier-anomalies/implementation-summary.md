## What Was Built

The implementation delivered deterministic indexing and tier normalization for Spec 143.

### Code Changes

- Added canonical-path-aware deduplication and filtering behavior in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/parsing/memory-parser.ts`.
- Enforced unique merged file set before batch indexing in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/handlers/memory-index.ts`.
- Normalized default tier mapping and precedence behavior in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/scoring/importance-tiers.ts`.

### Test Coverage Updates

- Updated `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/memory-parser.vitest.ts` for tier precedence and parser edge cases.
- Updated `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/handler-memory-index.vitest.ts` for alias-root dedup regression protection.
- Updated `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/importance-tiers.vitest.ts` for tier mapping consistency.

## How It Was Delivered

Delivery followed the plan's setup -> implementation -> verification progression with scoped changes only.

1. Regression-oriented tests were used to verify alias-root and tier-precedence behavior.
2. Core dedup/tier logic was implemented in parser, index handler, and tier utility modules.
3. Verification evidence was captured with targeted/extended test runs, scoped ESLint, and spec validation.
4. Level 3 documentation was synchronized to implemented state (tasks, checklist, ADR statuses, and this summary).

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Accept ADR-001 (canonical path dedup before indexing) | Eliminates alias-root duplication while preserving dual-root compatibility |
| Accept ADR-002 (metadata -> inline marker -> default tier precedence) | Makes tier resolution deterministic and explainable across parser/scoring paths |
| Keep verification scope targeted instead of full-repo lint | Project-wide lint has unrelated pre-existing failures; scoped lint proves this change set is clean |

## Verification

| Check | Result |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

1. Project-wide `npm run lint` remains failing due to unrelated pre-existing issues outside this spec's file scope.
2. Historical duplicate memory rows cleanup is not included in this spec and remains follow-up work.
3. Dedicated scan performance/load benchmarks were not run in this implementation pass.
