# Feature Specification: Memory Index Deduplication and Tier Normalization

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

`memory_index_scan` can index the same logical files twice when both `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` resolve to the same tree through symlinks or mirrored paths. This inflates scan counts, can create duplicate memory records, and makes retrieval behavior noisy.

The same workflow also shows tier inconsistencies when parsed metadata and document-type defaults are applied differently across scan and save paths. This spec defines one canonical indexing path strategy and one deterministic tier resolution strategy.

**Key Decisions**: canonical path dedup before indexing; deterministic tier precedence for all indexed markdown docs.

**Critical Dependencies**: existing incremental-index metadata and memory parser behavior must remain backward compatible.

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
The index scan currently collects files from both `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` roots. If one path is a symlink or alias of the other, identical files can enter the same scan batch twice. This can overcount scanned/indexed totals and introduce duplicate rows for the same logical artifact.

In parallel, tier assignment is not explicitly documented as a single precedence chain across parser metadata, inline markers, and document-type defaults. This causes tier anomalies that are hard to diagnose during search ranking and auditing.

### Purpose
Make indexing deterministic by deduplicating canonical file paths before indexing and by enforcing one clear tier precedence model with regression coverage.

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Canonical path deduplication in memory file discovery and index scan assembly.
- Tier precedence normalization for spec docs, memory docs, and constitutional docs.
- Regression tests covering symlink alias scanning and tier resolution edge cases.
- Validation that incremental scan metrics remain accurate after dedup.

### Out of Scope
- Changes to embedding model providers or vector DB schema.
- Search relevance algorithm redesign outside tier-normalization fixes.
- Migration of historical duplicate data already stored in production indexes.

## 4. REQUIREMENTS

### P0 - Blockers (MUST complete)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-001 | Canonical file path deduplication occurs before indexing batches are created | A scan where `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` point to same files indexes each logical file once |
| REQ-002 | Index scan counters report unique-file totals | `scanned`, `indexed`, and `unchanged` are not inflated by alias roots |
| REQ-003 | Tier resolution follows documented precedence | Tests prove deterministic result for metadata tier, inline markers, and defaults |
| REQ-004 | Constitutional tier handling stays intact | Constitutional docs still surface with expected always-surface behavior |
| REQ-005 | Regression tests protect against symlink/alias duplication | New tests fail before fix and pass after fix |

### P1 - Required (complete OR user-approved deferral)

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria |
|----|-------------|---------------------|
| REQ-006 | Diagnostic output explains dedup decisions in verbose logs | Debug logs show deduped path counts and skipped aliases |
| REQ-007 | Spec and implementation docs reflect final tier precedence rules | `plan.md`, `decision-record.md`, and `implementation-summary.md` stay synchronized |
| REQ-008 | Tier fallback behavior is explicit for invalid metadata values | Invalid or unknown tiers resolve to documented defaults in tests |

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: Alias-path scans no longer create duplicate indexing operations.
- **SC-002**: Tier assignment is deterministic and test-covered.
- **SC-003**: No regression in constitutional memory surfacing behavior.
- **SC-004**: Validation and test suite pass with no new errors.

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | Filesystem behavior differs across macOS/Linux symlink handling | Dedup can miss path aliases on one platform | Normalize with `realpath` and path separator normalization in tests |
| Risk | Over-aggressive dedup could drop valid distinct files | Missing index coverage | Dedup key uses canonical absolute path only after existence checks |
| Risk | Tier precedence change can alter ranking behavior | Search result order shifts | Add explicit before/after tests for representative document types |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Dedup step adds negligible overhead (<5% to scan time in local test corpus).

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: No file writes outside existing index and metadata storage paths.

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Re-running scans on unchanged trees remains idempotent.
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty memory directories still return zero-scan success.
- Duplicate file discovered through more than two alias roots is indexed once.

### Error Scenarios
- Broken symlink entries are skipped without aborting full scan.
- Invalid tier metadata falls back to documented default tier.

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Deterministic Indexing (Priority: P0)

**As a** platform maintainer, **I want** one logical file to be indexed once regardless of alias paths, **so that** the memory database stays clean and metrics stay trustworthy.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given alias roots that point to the same file tree, when `memory_index_scan` runs, then each canonical file path is processed once.

---

### US-002: Predictable Tier Assignment (Priority: P0)

**As a** retrieval-system maintainer, **I want** deterministic tier precedence, **so that** ranking and memory behavior are explainable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given conflicting metadata signals, when a file is parsed, then tier resolution follows one documented precedence chain.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## 11.5 ACCEPTANCE SCENARIOS

1. **Alias roots deduped**
   **Given** `specs/` and `.opencode/specs/` resolve to the same tree
   **When** `memory_index_scan` runs
   **Then** each canonical file path is indexed once.

2. **Spec folder filtering preserved**
   **Given** a `specFolder` filter for one child spec
   **When** canonicalization and dedup are applied
   **Then** files outside the filtered subtree are excluded.

3. **Tier metadata precedence**
   **Given** a memory file with valid YAML tier metadata and inline tier marker mismatch
   **When** parsing runs
   **Then** YAML metadata tier wins.

4. **Inline marker fallback**
   **Given** a file without tier metadata but with inline marker
   **When** parsing runs
   **Then** marker tier is used.

5. **Document-type fallback**
   **Given** a file with no explicit tier signals
   **When** parsing runs
   **Then** document-type default tier is applied.

6. **Invalid tier safety**
   **Given** malformed tier metadata
   **When** parser normalizes the tier
   **Then** a valid default tier is applied without crashing.
