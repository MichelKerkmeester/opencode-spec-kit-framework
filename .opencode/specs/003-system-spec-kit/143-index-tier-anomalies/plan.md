# Implementation Plan: Memory Index Deduplication and Tier Normalization

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan-core | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:summary -->
## 1. SUMMARY

### Technical Context

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Language/Stack** | TypeScript (Node.js) |
| **Framework** | MCP server handlers + parser libraries |
| **Storage** | SQLite context index + incremental metadata |
| **Testing** | Vitest |

### Overview
This implementation introduces a canonical-path dedup pass before index batching and a single tier-precedence model used across parser and scoring logic. Delivery is test-first for duplicate-source regression and tier-resolution edge cases, then scoped code fixes, then validation and documentation sync.

## 3. ARCHITECTURE

### Pattern
Targeted pipeline hardening with deterministic normalization stages.

### Key Components
- **`findMemoryFiles` scanner**: discovers candidate memory files from supported roots.
- **`findSpecDocuments` scanner**: discovers spec markdown docs under allowed trees.
- **`handleMemoryIndexScan` orchestrator**: merges candidates, applies incremental filtering, batches indexing.
- **Tier utilities (`importance-tiers`)**: provides normalization and default tier mapping.

### Data Flow
1. Discover candidates from memory and spec-document roots.
2. Canonicalize and deduplicate file paths.
3. Run incremental categorization on unique path set.
4. Index unique files, update mtimes, and emit accurate counters.
5. Parse/assign tiers using documented precedence.

<!-- ANCHOR:phases -->
## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Add failing regression tests for alias-root duplication.
- [ ] Add failing tier-resolution tests for mixed metadata signals.
- [ ] Confirm current baseline behavior and capture outputs.

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Add canonical-path dedup in scan assembly path.
- [ ] Keep specFolder filtering correct after canonicalization.
- [ ] Apply deterministic tier precedence in parser/scoring flow.
- [ ] Ensure counters and unchanged metrics use deduped set.

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Run targeted Vitest files and confirm new assertions pass.
- [ ] Run broader MCP server test subset for regression safety.
- [ ] Update checklist with command-level evidence.

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

| Test Type | Scope | Tools |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Unit | parser tier extraction and normalization | Vitest (`memory-parser.vitest.ts`, `importance-tiers.vitest.ts`) |
| Integration | scan merge/dedup and counter integrity | Vitest (`handler-memory-index.vitest.ts`) |
| Manual | targeted `memory_index_scan` sanity with alias roots | local MCP invocation |

## 6. DEPENDENCIES

| Dependency | Type | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| Existing incremental index metadata logic | Internal | Green | inaccurate changed/unchanged behavior |
| Filesystem `realpath` behavior consistency | Platform | Yellow | dedup mismatch across environments |
| Current tier config constants | Internal | Green | ranking regression risk |
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:rollback -->
## 7. ROLLBACK PLAN

- **Trigger**: Scan counts or ranking behavior regress in targeted tests.
- **Procedure**: Revert scanner/indexer tier changes, re-run baseline tests, and preserve regression tests for next pass.

## L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- [ ] Baseline behavior captured before edits
- [ ] Scoped file list confirmed
- [ ] Targeted test commands documented

### Rollback Procedure
1. Revert only scanner/indexer/tier files touched by this spec.
2. Re-run targeted tests and baseline scan checks.
3. Confirm duplicate behavior is restored only if intentional rollback.
4. Re-open unresolved tasks in `tasks.md`.

### Data Reversal
- **Has data migrations?** No
- **Reversal procedure**: Not applicable

## L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Regression tests defined and failing** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL
2. **Canonical dedup integrated in scan pipeline** - 2-3 hours - CRITICAL
3. **Tier precedence normalization implemented** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL
4. **Verification and evidence capture complete** - 1-2 hours - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: 5-9 hours

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Parser-tier tests and scan dedup tests can be authored in parallel.
- Checklist and implementation-summary updates can run alongside final verification.

## L3: ARCHITECTURE DECISION RECORD

### ADR-001: Canonical dedup and explicit tier precedence

**Status**: Proposed

**Context**: Duplicate alias roots and inconsistent tier interpretation undermine deterministic indexing and ranking.

**Decision**: Canonicalize and deduplicate file paths before indexing. Resolve tiers by a strict precedence chain and verify with regression tests.

**Consequences**:
- Better index integrity and stable counters.
- Slightly more preprocessing complexity in scan assembly.

**Alternatives Rejected**:
- Restrict scan to one root only, because it breaks compatibility with current dual-root support.

## AI EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Pre-Task Checklist
- [ ] Confirm active file list matches `tasks.md` scope.
- [ ] Confirm baseline tests are reproducible before edits.
- [ ] Confirm no unrelated refactors are included.

### Execution Rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---------|------|
| TASK-SEQ | Execute phases in order: setup, implementation, verification |
| TASK-SCOPE | Only modify files listed in `spec.md` unless checklist documents scope expansion |
| TASK-VERIFY | Run targeted tests after each core implementation task |

### Status Reporting Format
- Report status as: `done`, `in-progress`, or `blocked`.
- Include artifact path and evidence command for each completed verification task.

### Blocked Task Protocol
- Mark blocked tasks as `[B]` in `tasks.md`.
- Record blocker reason and immediate next action.
- Do not continue to downstream blocked tasks until blocker is resolved or deferred with approval.
