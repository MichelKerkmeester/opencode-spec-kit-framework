<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user-approved deferral |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

State source of truth is `tasks.md` in this folder.
