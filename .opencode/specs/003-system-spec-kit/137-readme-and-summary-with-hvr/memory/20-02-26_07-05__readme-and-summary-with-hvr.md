<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed the HVR integration work by relocating hvr_rules.md from assets/documentation/ to references/ (it is loaded into agent context, not used as an output template). Updated 19 path references across 13 files: SKILL.md (3 lines), install_guide_template.md (1 line), readme_template.md (2 lines), hvr_rules.md internal links (2 lines), and 8 SpecKit templates (2 lines each for HVR_REFERENCE comment + footer). Fixed the outdated quick_reference.md Section 7 file tree which had wrong subdirectory structure and was missing 10 files. Ran full audits: 7 reference files (0/7 mention HVR, noted as future gap), 6 scripts + test suite (all UP TO DATE), 8 YAML create workflows (all clean), 5 opencode templates (all clean). Created changelogs for workflows-documentation v1.0.9.0 and system-spec-kit v2.2.23.0. Bumped SKILL.md versions. Created environment changelog v2.1.4.0, updated PUBLIC_RELEASE.md, committed, tagged, and published GitHub release v2.1.4.0.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Completed the HVR integration work by relocating hvr_rules.md from assets/documentation/ to...
- Decision: Moved hvr_rules.
- Decision: Used relative paths .
- Decision: Left spec 137 historical files (spec.
- Decision: Bumped to v2.

## 3. DETAILED CHANGES

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation-completed-hvr-integration-work-861f2d2d -->
### FEATURE: Completed the HVR integration work by relocating hvr_rules.md from assets/documentation/ to...

Completed the HVR integration work by relocating hvr_rules.md from assets/documentation/ to references/ (it is loaded into agent context, not used as an output template). Updated 19 path references across 13 files: SKILL.md (3 lines), install_guide_template.md (1 line), readme_template.md (2 lines), hvr_rules.md internal links (2 lines), and 8 SpecKit templates (2 lines each for HVR_REFERENCE comment + footer). Fixed the outdated quick_reference.md Section 7 file tree which had wrong subdirectory structure and was missing 10 files. Ran full audits: 7 reference files (0/7 mention HVR, noted as future gap), 6 scripts + test suite (all UP TO DATE), 8 YAML create workflows (all clean), 5 opencode templates (all clean). Created changelogs for workflows-documentation v1.0.9.0 and system-spec-kit v2.2.23.0. Bumped SKILL.md versions. Created environment changelog v2.1.4.0, updated PUBLIC_RELEASE.md, committed, tagged, and published GitHub release v2.1.4.0.

**Details:** hvr_rules.md relocation | move assets to references | HVR path update | quick_reference file tree | implementation-summary template | version bump workflows-documentation | version bump system-spec-kit | GitHub release v2.1.4.0 | reference audit | create command audit | script audit workflows-documentation
<!-- /ANCHOR:implementation-completed-hvr-integration-work-861f2d2d -->

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation-technical-implementation-details-b38918d8 -->
### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: hvr_rules.md was classified as an asset (output template) but functions as a reference (loaded into agent context). The file tree in quick_reference.md was outdated, missing subdirectory structure and 10 files.; solution: Moved file to references/, updated all 19 path references across 13 files using 3 context agents for parallel discovery. Fixed file tree to show actual on-disk structure. Published as GitHub release v2.1.4.0.; patterns: Used 3 parallel context agents for comprehensive audit: (1) path reference discovery, (2) reference file analysis, (3) script currency check. All audits confirmed zero scripts reference hvr_rules.md and all create commands are clean after the move.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/137-readme-and-summary-with-hvr` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/137-readme-and-summary-with-hvr" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/137-readme-and-summary-with-hvr", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/137-readme-and-summary-with-hvr/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/137-readme-and-summary-with-hvr --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
