title: "To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always [129-spec-doc-anchor-tags/16-02-26_14-12__spec-doc-anchor-tags]"

<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**What Was Built**:

- **Continued Spec 129 anchor retrofit by adding anchor tags to all spec documents in the three...** - Continued Spec 129 anchor retrofit by adding anchor tags to all spec documents in the three z_archive directories (004-agents, 005-anobel.

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Spec 129 added anchor tags to templates but existing archived spec docs in z_archive directories had no anchors; solution: Multi-agent parallel dispatch (5 agents) to add anchors to all H2 sections in archived spec docs, with Python fallback for stragglers; patterns: Anchor ID derivation: strip leading numbers/prefixes, lowercase, hyphenate, remove special chars.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode/specs/004-agents/z_archive/ (36 files anchored)` - File modified (description pending)

- `.opencode/.../z_archive/ (123 files anchored)` - File modified (description pending)

- `.opencode/.../005-agent-system-improvements/prompt.md (DELETED)` - File modified (description pending)

**How to Extend**:

- Create corresponding test files for new implementations

- Use established template patterns for new outputs

**Common Patterns**:

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Graceful Fallback**: Provide sensible defaults when primary method fails

- **Data Normalization**: Clean and standardize data before use

- **Functional Transforms**: Use functional methods for data transformation

## 2. OVERVIEW

Continued Spec 129 anchor retrofit by adding anchor tags to all spec documents in the three z_archive directories (004-agents, 005-anobel.com, 003-system-spec-kit). Dispatched 5 parallel agents that successfully anchored 159 files with ~1,412 anchor pairs total. Also cleaned up 5 empty/abandoned z_archive folders and removed 1 non-anchorable prompt.md file. 4 files were correctly identified as non-anchorable (no H2 headings). The archive anchor retrofit is now complete.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/129-spec-doc-anchor-tags` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/129-spec-doc-anchor-tags" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/129-spec-doc-anchor-tags", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/129-spec-doc-anchor-tags/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/129-spec-doc-anchor-tags --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
