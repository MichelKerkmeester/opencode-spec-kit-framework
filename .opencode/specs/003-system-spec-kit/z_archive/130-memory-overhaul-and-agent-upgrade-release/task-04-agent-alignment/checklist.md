## P0 — Model Assignments

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Handover agent = Haiku on OpenCode (`.opencode/agent/handover.md`) [Evidence: Agent A16 verified cross-platform alignment]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Handover agent = Haiku on Claude Code (`.claude/agents/handover.md`) [Evidence: Agent A17 switched model from sonnet to haiku]
- [x] CHK-003 [P0] Handover agent = fast profile on Codex (`.codex/agents/handover.md`) [Evidence: Agent A18 verified Codex frontmatter alignment]
- [x] CHK-004 [P0] Review agent model-agnostic on OpenCode (`.opencode/agent/review.md`) [Evidence: Agent A16 added spec-015 note about model-agnostic frontmatter]
- [x] CHK-005 [P0] Review agent model-agnostic on Claude Code (`.claude/agents/review.md`) [Evidence: Agent A17 updated frontmatter descriptions]
- [x] CHK-006 [P0] Review agent = readonly profile on Codex (`.codex/agents/review.md`) [Evidence: Agent A18 verified Codex profile alignment]

## P0 — Codex Frontmatter

- [x] CHK-007 [P0] All 8 `.codex/agents/*.md` files use Codex-native frontmatter [Evidence: Agent A18 preserved Codex frontmatter while updating bodies]
- [ ] CHK-008 [P0] `.codex/config.toml` has 4 profiles (fast, balanced, powerful, readonly) [PENDING: config.toml not modified in wave1]
- [ ] CHK-009 [P0] `.codex/config.toml` has sub-agent dispatch MCP [PENDING: config.toml not modified in wave1]

## P1 — AGENTS.md + Consistency

- [x] CHK-010 [P1] `AGENTS.md` routing rules include all spec 014 additions [Evidence: Agent A20 added cross-platform mapping and tier details]
- [x] CHK-011 [P1] `AGENTS.md` notes handover = Haiku [Evidence: Agent A20 documented fast-tier routing including handover]
- [x] CHK-012 [P1] `AGENTS.md` notes review = model-agnostic [Evidence: Agent A20 documented read-only tier with model-agnostic behavior]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Agent body content consistent across all 3 platforms [Evidence: Agent A16/A17/A18 synchronized bodies with explicit parity notes]

## P2 — Description Consistency

- [x] CHK-020 [P2] Agent descriptions match between platforms [Evidence: Agents A17 and A18 aligned frontmatter descriptions]
- [x] CHK-021 [P2] All 8 agents listed in AGENTS.md [Evidence: Agent A20 updated agent routing table]

## Output Verification

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] changes.md populated with all required edits [Evidence: changes.md contains 25 file updates across 4 agents]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] No placeholder text in changes.md [Evidence: All entries contain concrete evidence from agent notes]
