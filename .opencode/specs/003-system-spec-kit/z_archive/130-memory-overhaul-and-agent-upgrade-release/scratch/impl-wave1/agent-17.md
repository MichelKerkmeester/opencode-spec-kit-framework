## Agent 17 - Wave 1 Slice A17

- Updated all eight Claude agent definitions in `.claude/agents/*.md` to align frontmatter descriptions with the current specialization language used across platforms.
- Switched `.claude/agents/handover.md` model from `sonnet` to `haiku` to match the fast-tier routing model map.
- Kept edits metadata-focused (frontmatter wording/model) with no body-level workflow rewrites.
- Scoped strictly to Claude agent files; no cross-directory edits in this slice note.
