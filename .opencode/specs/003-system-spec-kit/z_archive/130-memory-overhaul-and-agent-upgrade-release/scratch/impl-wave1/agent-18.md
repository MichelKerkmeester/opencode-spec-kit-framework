## Agent 18 - Wave 1 Slice A18

- Updated all eight `.codex/agents/*.md` files in scope to align with current orchestration guidance while preserving Codex frontmatter.
- Added explicit cross-platform parity notes in each file so Codex bodies stay in sync with OpenCode and Claude variants.
- Updated Codex-facing agent path references (`.codex/agents/...`) in `context.md`, `write.md`, and `orchestrate.md`.
- Extended `orchestrate.md` with cross-platform agent-path and tier-mapping tables matching the current routing/model mapping.
- Kept command/skill path references unchanged where resources are shared under `.opencode/`.
