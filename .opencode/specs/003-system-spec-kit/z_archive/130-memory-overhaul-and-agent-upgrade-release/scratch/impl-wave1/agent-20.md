## Agent 20 - Wave 1 Slice A20

- Updated top-level framework docs for post-spec126 alignment in `README.md`, `.opencode/README.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.
- Added/clarified 5-source indexing, 7-intent routing, schema v13 metadata fields (`document_type`, `spec_level`), and hardening behavior references.
- Added cross-platform agent file mapping and model-tier mapping details in `AGENTS.md` (including Codex profile mapping and subfolder save-path support notes).
- Kept changes documentation-only and scoped to release-level framework docs.
