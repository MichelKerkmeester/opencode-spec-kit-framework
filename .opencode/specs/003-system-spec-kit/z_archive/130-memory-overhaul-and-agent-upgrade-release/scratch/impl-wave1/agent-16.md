## Agent 16 - Wave 1 Slice A16

- Updated eight OpenCode agent docs to add an explicit cross-platform body-sync convention (OpenCode/Claude/Codex parity, frontmatter remains platform-specific).
- Aligned `review.md` and `orchestrate.md` references from legacy `workflows-code` to current `workflows-code--web-dev` and `workflows-code--full-stack` conventions.
- Added explicit spec-015 note in `review.md` that frontmatter stays model-agnostic for parent-model inheritance.
- Removed stale `WebSearch` tool mention from `research.md` to match current available tooling.
- Kept tone, structure, and scope intact; no out-of-scope file edits.
