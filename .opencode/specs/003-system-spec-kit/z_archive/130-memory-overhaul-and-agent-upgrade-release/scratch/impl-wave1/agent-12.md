## Agent 12 - Wave 1 Slice A12

- Updated Level docs to align with current v2.2 template architecture and script-assisted verification flow (`validate.sh`, `check-completion.sh`, `check-placeholders.sh`).
- Added explicit Level 3+ guidance to template/workflow references, including copy commands from `templates/level_3+/` and stronger governance/AI protocol expectations.
- Corrected mismatches with current implementation state: required `implementation-summary.md` at Level 3/3+, metadata level values (`1/2/3/3+`), and sub-folder workflow language to include `create.sh --subfolder` behavior.
- Kept edits strictly within requested docs plus this scratch note.
