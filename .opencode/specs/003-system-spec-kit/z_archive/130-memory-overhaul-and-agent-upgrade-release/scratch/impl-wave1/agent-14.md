# Agent 14 - Wave 1 Slice A14

- Updated `.opencode/command/spec_kit/complete.md` to align routing/process language with current system-spec-kit behavior: `implementation-summary.md` marked mandatory for Level 1+, review routing references moved to Step 12 completion verification, and fallback `subagent_type` standardized to `general`.
- Updated `.opencode/command/spec_kit/research.md` to standardize fallback routing to `subagent_type: "general"` and to keep review/research language model-agnostic per spec 015.
- Updated `.opencode/command/spec_kit/debug.md` to clarify that `@review` in Step 5 is advisory and model-agnostic.
- Kept edits scoped to requested files plus this scratch note.
