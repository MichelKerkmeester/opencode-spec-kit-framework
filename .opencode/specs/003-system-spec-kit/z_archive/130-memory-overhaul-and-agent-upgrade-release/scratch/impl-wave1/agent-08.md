## Agent 08 - Wave 1 Slice A08 Notes

Updated the 9 requested template README files to align with the current level architecture and workflow behavior.

Key alignment points:
- clarified CORE + ADDENDUM composition and source-vs-ready template usage
- standardized level summaries (Level 1, 2, 3, 3+) with current required file sets
- added workflow notes for checklist priority order, implementation-summary timing, and memory save rules
- tightened language to concise, ASCII-only guidance

Checks run:
- `git diff --check` on all scoped files: pass (no whitespace/conflict-marker issues)
