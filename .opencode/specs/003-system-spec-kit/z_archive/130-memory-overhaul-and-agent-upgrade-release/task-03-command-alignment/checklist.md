<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->

## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

## P0 — Agent Routing

- [ ] CHK-001 [P0] All 6 create command .md files have correct agent routing [PENDING: Wave1 did not audit create command .md files]
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] All 7 spec_kit command .md files have correct agent routing [Evidence: Agents A14 and A15 standardized fallback routing to "general"]
- [x] CHK-003 [P0] `spec_kit/complete.md` references check-placeholders.sh (spec 128) [Evidence: Agent A14 aligned with current workflow]
- [x] CHK-004 [P0] `spec_kit/handover.md` references Haiku model (spec 016) [Evidence: Agent A15 clarified orchestration and routing]

## P1 — Memory Commands + Assets

- [x] CHK-010 [P1] `memory/context.md` describes 5-source pipeline and 7 intents [Evidence: Agent A13 updated with L1 budget guidance and MCP flow]
- [x] CHK-011 [P1] `memory/save.md` describes spec doc indexing [Evidence: Agent A13 documented asyncEmbedding and corrected behavior]
- [ ] CHK-012 [P1] All 12 create YAML assets match .md routing [PENDING: Wave1 focused on .md files only, YAML assets deferred]
- [ ] CHK-013 [P1] All 10 spec_kit YAML assets reference current scripts [PENDING: YAML asset audit deferred to wave2]
- [x] CHK-014 [P1] `memory/learn.md` and `memory/manage.md` current [Evidence: Agent A13 updated both files with v13 schema and current behavior]

## P2 — YAML/MD Consistency

- [ ] CHK-020 [P2] YAML asset filenames match command .md names [PENDING: YAML asset audit deferred]
- [ ] CHK-021 [P2] No stale script paths in YAML workflows [PENDING: YAML asset audit deferred]

## Output Verification

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] changes.md populated with all required edits [Evidence: changes.md contains 11 file updates across 3 agents]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] No placeholder text in changes.md [Evidence: All entries contain concrete evidence from agent notes]
