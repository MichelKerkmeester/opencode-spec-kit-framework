| 6 | **Attempt counter missing** | handover.md | Added attempt counter logic with increment instructions |
| 7 | **MCP syntax wrong** | resume.md | Changed `mcp__semantic_memory__` → `semantic_memory_` |

### P2 - Medium (10+ issues)

| # | Issue | File | Fix |
|---|-------|------|-----|
| 1 | Duplicate section numbering | plan.md | Renumbered sections 6→7→8 |
| 2 | Duplicate section 12 | spec.md template | Changed CHANGELOG to section 13 |
| 3 | P3 priority undefined | checklist.md | Removed P3 option, aligned P1/P2 definitions |
| 4 | Custom sections structure | SKILL.md | Moved sections to H3 under HOW IT WORKS |
| 5 | Checklists/ undocumented | SKILL.md | Added documentation for 4 phase checklists |

## 3. Verification Results

### Phase 3: Verification (10 Agents)

| Category | Agent | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| skill_advisor.py | Agent 1 | ✅ PASS |
| AGENTS.md Gate 5 | Agent 2 | ✅ PASS |
| New Templates | Agent 3 | ✅ PASS |
| debug.md | Agent 4 | ✅ PASS |
| generate-context.js | Agent 5 | ✅ PASS |
| Command Files | Agent 6 | ✅ PASS |
| SKILL.md + README.md | Agent 7 | ✅ PASS (after fix) |
| Template Files | Agent 8 | ✅ PASS |
| Reference Docs | Agent 9 | ✅ PASS |
| Cross-Consistency | Agent 10 | ✅ PASS (after fix) |

### Cross-Consistency Verified

| Resource Type | Expected | Found | Status |
|---------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Templates | 12 | 12 | ✅ |
| Scripts | 7 | 7 | ✅ |
| Checklists | 4 | 4 | ✅ |
| References | 6 | 6 | ✅ |

## 4. Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Use parallel agents | Maximize efficiency for large-scale analysis | Sequential analysis (too slow) |
| Fix all priorities in one pass | Comprehensive fix prevents regression | Fix only P0/P1 (leaves technical debt) |
| Create new templates | Commands referenced non-existent files | Remove references (breaks functionality) |
| Restructure SKILL.md | Template compliance, maintainability | Leave as-is (inconsistent with template) |

## 5. Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- SKILL.md section structure changed from flat H2 to nested H3 under HOW IT WORKS
- Template count increased from 10 to 12

### Dependencies Added
None

### Configuration Changes
- skill_advisor.py now uses `__file__` for path resolution instead of `os.getcwd()`
- Added `--health` CLI flag to skill_advisor.py for diagnostics

## 6. Known Limitations

- One `substr()` call remains in `simulation-factory.js` (different file, low priority)
- YAML diagnostic error in `spec_kit_plan_auto.yaml` (pre-existing, not addressed)

## 7. Next Steps

Implementation complete. Recommended follow-up:
- [ ] Fix remaining `substr()` in simulation-factory.js
- [ ] Investigate YAML error in spec_kit_plan_auto.yaml
- [ ] Monitor skill_advisor.py health check in production
