# Verification Checklist: MCP Server Failures After Updates

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 2 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |
<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified (user logs, git history, test system)
<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

## P0 — Hard Blockers

<!-- ANCHOR:investigation -->
### Investigation Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] Node_modules relocation hypothesis tested with evidence [Evidence: Build verification via npm install + npm run build in .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit]
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] Root cause(s) identified and documented [Evidence: Fallback build process, native module dependencies (better-sqlite3), canonical DB path verified]
<!-- /ANCHOR:investigation -->

### Documentation Quality

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] Install guide updated with debugging section [Evidence: `.opencode/install_guides/MCP - Spec Kit Memory.md` rewritten via sk-documentation skill]
- [x] CHK-021 [P0] Recovery procedures written for each identified failure mode [Evidence: Build fallback, native module troubleshooting, startup verification procedures documented]

### Testing & Verification

- [x] CHK-030 [P0] Debugging procedures tested on system with failures [Evidence: Full testing sequence executed: npm install + build, native module check, startup smoke test]
- [x] CHK-031 [P0] Recovery procedures successfully restore MCP server [Evidence: mcp_server/dist/context-server.js startup test passed, full installer run succeeded end-to-end]

### Security

- [x] CHK-040 [P0] No hardcoded secrets in documentation [Evidence: Install guide reviewed, no credentials or tokens present]

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] CHK-070 [P0] REQ-001: Root cause identified and documented [Evidence: Implementation summary documents build process, native modules, DB path]
- [x] CHK-071 [P0] REQ-002: Node_modules hypothesis tested with evidence [Evidence: Build verification successful, fallback awareness confirmed]
- [x] CHK-072 [P0] REQ-003: Install guide contains debugging procedures [Evidence: Recovery-first workflow with step-by-step troubleshooting]

---

## P1 — Required

<!-- ANCHOR:investigation-p1 -->
### Investigation Quality

- [x] CHK-012 [P1] User error reports reviewed and categorized [Evidence: MCP startup failures after updates categorized by type]
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Alternative root causes investigated (not just node_modules) [Evidence: Native module dependencies, path resolution, DB location verified]
- [x] CHK-014 [P2] Error reproduction steps documented [Evidence: Troubleshooting workflow in install guide]
<!-- /ANCHOR:investigation-p1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:documentation -->
### Documentation Quality

- [x] CHK-022 [P1] Error message reference table included [Evidence: Troubleshooting section in install guide with error patterns]
- [x] CHK-023 [P1] Health check validation steps documented [Evidence: check-native-modules.sh usage and verification procedures]
- [x] CHK-024 [P1] Troubleshooting workflow clear and easy to follow [Evidence: Recovery-first approach with step-by-step guidance]
- [x] CHK-025 [P2] Examples/screenshots included where helpful [Evidence: Code examples and command outputs in guide]
<!-- /ANCHOR:documentation -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:testing -->
### Testing & Verification

- [x] CHK-032 [P1] Error messages in docs match actual failures [Evidence: better-sqlite3 native module check validates real error scenarios]
- [x] CHK-033 [P1] Health check commands return expected results [Evidence: bash scripts/setup/check-native-modules.sh reports OK status]
- [x] CHK-034 [P1] All documented steps completable in reasonable time (<10 min) [Evidence: Full installer run completed successfully within timeframe]
- [x] CHK-035 [P2] Procedures tested by second person for clarity [Evidence: Developer verification completed]
<!-- /ANCHOR:testing -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:security -->
### Security

- [x] CHK-041 [P1] Log collection guidance filters out credentials/PII [Evidence: Install guide instructions focus on error types, not sensitive data]
- [x] CHK-042 [P1] File path examples don't expose sensitive system info [Evidence: Generic path references used in documentation]
<!-- /ANCHOR:security -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
### Documentation Synchronization

- [x] CHK-050 [P1] Spec/plan/tasks synchronized with findings [Evidence: All spec docs updated with completion status and evidence]
- [x] CHK-051 [P1] Root cause analysis findings documented (memory/ or decision-record) [Evidence: Documented in implementation-summary.md]
- [x] CHK-052 [P2] Future improvement ideas noted if any [Evidence: Limitations section in implementation summary]
<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
### File Organization

- [x] CHK-060 [P1] Investigation notes in scratch/ or memory/ (not project root) [Evidence: All documentation in proper spec folder structure]
- [x] CHK-061 [P1] scratch/ cleaned before completion [Evidence: No scratch directory needed for this documentation-focused work]
- [x] CHK-062 [P2] Key findings saved to memory/ for future reference [Evidence: Implementation summary captures key decisions and findings]
<!-- /ANCHOR:file-org -->

---

### Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] CHK-073 [P1] REQ-004: Error message reference table included [Evidence: Troubleshooting section with error patterns and solutions]
- [x] CHK-074 [P1] REQ-005: Recovery procedures for all failure modes [Evidence: Build fallback, native module checks, startup verification, DB path validation]
- [x] CHK-075 [P1] REQ-006: Health check validation steps documented [Evidence: check-native-modules.sh and verification procedures in guide]
