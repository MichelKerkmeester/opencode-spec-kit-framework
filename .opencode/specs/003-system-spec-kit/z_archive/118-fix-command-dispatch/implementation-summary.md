## Overview

Fixed a command dispatch vulnerability where OpenCode's Go runtime injected phantom dispatch instructions at render time, causing wrong agent dispatch instead of following structured YAML workflows. Applied 5 systematic fixes across 7 command files and 11 YAML workflow files. Additionally aligned all 7 command files with sk-documentation style standards (H2 emojis, decimal step renumbering).

### Root Cause

Two-factor failure:

1. **Phantom dispatch text** injected by runtime based on `@agent` references + `allowed-tools: Task` in frontmatter
2. **Structural issues** — execution instructions buried at lines 140-183, missing guardrails, unfenced dispatch templates

---

## What Was Built

Five fix types applied in four implementation waves, followed by style alignment:

### Fix A — Imperative Guardrail (all 7 .md files)

- Added `DO NOT dispatch agents directly` guardrail block after frontmatter (lines 7-18)
- Files: complete.md, debug.md, implement.md, research.md, plan.md, handover.md, resume.md

### Fix B — YAML Loading Instruction at Top (all 7 .md files)

- Combined with Fix A guardrail block — instruction to LOAD the YAML workflow file appears within first 15 lines
- AI now sees what to DO before encountering any dispatch templates

### Fix C — Fence Dispatch Templates (4 .md files)

- Wrapped unfenced dispatch templates with `<!-- REFERENCE ONLY -->` / `<!-- END REFERENCE -->` HTML comments
- complete.md: 7 fencing markers (6 templates)
- debug.md: 3 fencing markers
- research.md: 2 fencing markers (2 templates)
- plan.md: 2 fencing markers (2 templates)

### Fix D — Reduce @agent Density (2 .md files)

- complete.md: Reduced from 19 to ~9 @agent references
- debug.md: Reduced from 15 to ~9 @agent references

### Fix E — YAML REFERENCE Comments (11 YAML files)

- Added `# REFERENCE ONLY` comments before `agent_routing:` and `dispatch:` sections
- 30 total REFERENCE comments across 11 files:
  - spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml (4 comments)
  - spec_kit_complete_confirm.yaml (4 comments)
  - spec_kit_debug_auto.yaml (3 comments)
  - spec_kit_debug_confirm.yaml (3 comments)
  - spec_kit_research_auto.yaml (2 comments)
  - spec_kit_research_confirm.yaml (2 comments)
  - spec_kit_plan_auto.yaml (3 comments)
  - spec_kit_plan_confirm.yaml (3 comments)
  - spec_kit_implement_auto.yaml (2 comments)
  - spec_kit_implement_confirm.yaml (2 comments)
  - spec_kit_handover_full.yaml (2 comments)
- 2 YAML files skipped (resume_auto, resume_confirm — already clean)

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| complete.md | Fix A+B+C+D | Guardrail, YAML instruction, fencing (7 markers), density reduction (19→~9) |
| debug.md | Fix A+B+C+D | Guardrail, YAML instruction, fencing (3 markers), density reduction (15→~9) |
| research.md | Fix A+B+C | Guardrail, YAML instruction, fencing (2 markers) |
| plan.md | Fix A+B+C | Guardrail, YAML instruction, fencing (2 markers) |
| implement.md | Fix A+B | Guardrail, YAML instruction |
| handover.md | Fix A+B | Guardrail, YAML instruction |
| resume.md | Fix A+B | Guardrail, YAML instruction |
| 11 YAML workflow files | Fix E | REFERENCE ONLY comments (30 total) |

**Total: 18 files modified**

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Insert guardrail block instead of moving INSTRUCTIONS section | Avoids risky restructuring that could break section number cross-references in YAMLs; achieves both Fix A and Fix B goals with zero structural risk |
| Combined Fix A+B into single block | Minimizes insertion points; AI sees both the guardrail and what to do within first 15 lines |
| HTML comment fencing over removal | Preserves dispatch templates as documentation reference while preventing runtime misinterpretation |
| Skipped resume YAML files for Fix E | Already clean — no agent_routing or dispatch sections requiring REFERENCE comments |

## Implementation Waves

| Wave | Scope | Fixes | Status |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Wave 1 (5 agents) | All 7 .md files | Fix A+B guardrail insertion | COMPLETE |
| Wave 2 (5 agents) | complete.md, debug.md | Fix C+D fencing + density reduction | COMPLETE |
| Wave 3a (2 agents) | research.md, plan.md | Fix C fencing | COMPLETE |
| Wave 3b (3 agents) | 11 YAML files | Fix E YAML comments | COMPLETE |
| Style Pass (2 rounds) | All 7 .md files | H2 emojis + decimal renumbering | COMPLETE |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Spot-check (per-fix-type) | Pass | Verification agent checked representative samples across all fix types |
| Post-edit re-read | Pass | Each implementing agent re-read files after editing to confirm changes |
| Structural audit | Pass | Guardrails present in first 15 lines of all 7 command files |
| YAML integrity | Pass | REFERENCE comments placed correctly across 11 workflow files |
| Style compliance | Pass | 112/112 H2 headers have emojis; no decimal step numbering remains |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- **No live runtime testing** — Fixes are structural (comment-based guardrails and fencing); full validation requires observing AI behavior in actual command dispatch sessions
- **Density reduction is approximate** — complete.md and debug.md @agent counts are ~9 (not exact) due to necessary references retained in context
- **Resume YAML files untouched** — If these files gain dispatch sections in the future, they will need Fix E applied

## Style Alignment (sk-documentation)

After the 5 core fixes, all 7 command files were audited against `sk-documentation` standards (command template reference). Pre-fix style score: **76/100**.

### Style Fixes Applied

| Fix | Scope | Detail |
|-----|-------|--------|
| **H2 emojis** | All 7 .md files | Added emojis to all numbered H2 headers using command template vocabulary |
| **Decimal step renumbering** | plan.md | `## 7.5` renamed to `## 8.`, subsequent sections shifted sequentially |

### Emoji Coverage (Final Verification)

| File | H2 Count | Emoji Coverage | Notes |
|------|----------|----------------|-------|
| complete.md | 16 | 16/16 (100%) | Two rounds of fixes applied |
| debug.md | 15 | 15/15 (100%) | Two rounds of fixes applied; 1 H2 inside code block (correctly excluded) |
| implement.md | 17 | 17/17 (100%) | Includes `## 0.` section |
| research.md | 17 | 17/17 (100%) | Includes `## 0.` section |
| plan.md | 15 | 15/15 (100%) | Decimal step renumbered |
| handover.md | 15 | 15/15 (100%) | Clean after first round |
| resume.md | 17 | 17/17 (100%) | Clean after first round |
| **Total** | **112** | **112/112 (100%)** | |

### Style Items Accepted As-Is

- **Blocking phase pattern** (`PHASE N:`) — Used in all 7 files; accepted as valid alternative to standard numbering per command template conventions
