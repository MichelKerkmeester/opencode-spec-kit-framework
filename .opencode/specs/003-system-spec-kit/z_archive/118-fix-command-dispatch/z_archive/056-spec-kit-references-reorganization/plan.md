# Implementation Plan: system-spec-kit References Reorganization

## Overview

Reorganize the system-spec-kit `references/` folder from a flat structure into logical sub-folders, following patterns established in workflows-code skill improvement.

## Phase 1: Analyze Current Structure

**Objective:** Understand existing references/ contents and identify logical groupings

**Tasks:**
1. List all files in `references/` folder
2. Read each file to understand its purpose
3. Document file purposes and relationships
4. Identify natural groupings based on content domain

**Output:** Analysis document with file inventory and proposed groupings

## Phase 2: Design Sub-folder Organization

**Objective:** Create logical sub-folder structure based on analysis

**Tasks:**
1. Define sub-folder categories based on file groupings
2. Map each file to its target sub-folder
3. Review naming conventions for consistency
4. Document proposed structure

**Proposed Structure (to be refined after Phase 1):**
```
references/
├── memory/           # Memory system documentation
├── validation/       # Validation rules and patterns
├── templates/        # Template usage guides (if applicable)
└── workflows/        # Workflow documentation
```

**Output:** Finalized sub-folder structure with file mappings

## Phase 3: Move Files to Sub-folders

**Objective:** Execute the reorganization

**Tasks:**
1. Create new sub-folders
2. Move files to designated locations
3. Preserve git history where possible (git mv)
4. Verify all files successfully moved

**Output:** Reorganized references/ folder

## Phase 4: Update SKILL.md Routing and Paths

**Objective:** Ensure all references in SKILL.md point to correct new locations

**Tasks:**
1. Identify all path references in SKILL.md
2. Update each path to reflect new sub-folder locations
3. Update routing section with organized navigation
4. Check for any cross-references within moved files

**Output:** Updated SKILL.md with valid paths

## Phase 5: Verify and Document

**Objective:** Validate reorganization and create documentation

**Tasks:**
1. Grep for any remaining old paths
2. Test SKILL.md routing by reading referenced files
3. Verify no broken links exist
4. Create implementation-summary.md
5. Update checklist.md with completion evidence

**Output:** Verified reorganization with documentation

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Estimated Effort |
|-------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 15 minutes |
| Phase 2 | 10 minutes |
| Phase 3 | 10 minutes |
| Phase 4 | 20 minutes |
| Phase 5 | 15 minutes |
| **Total** | **~70 minutes** |

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Git provides full history of changes
2. Can revert file moves with `git checkout`
3. SKILL.md changes tracked in version control
