# Fix Summary: Memory Command Notation Update

**Date:** 2025-12-16  
**Spec Folder:** `007-memory-command-notation`  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Objective

Update memory command references from SLASH notation (`/memory/command`) to COLON notation (`/memory:command`) across all documentation files.

---

## Orchestration Summary

**Method:** 10 parallel sub-agents scanned different areas of the codebase  
**Analysis Tool:** Sequential Thinking MCP for task decomposition  
**Total Files Scanned:** 100+ files across specs/, .opencode/, z_install_guides/

## Preserved (Not Modified)

All file paths were correctly preserved:

- `specs/###-feature/memory/*.md` - Memory file storage paths
- `.opencode/memory/database/` - Database paths
- `.opencode/memory/scripts/` - Script paths
- `.opencode/command/memory/` - Command definition paths
- `specs/*/memory/` - Spec folder memory directories

---

## Agent Contributions

| Agent | Scope | Key Findings |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| Agent 1 | AGENTS.md | Already uses colon notation - no changes needed |
| Agent 2 | specs/ folder | 71 occurrences, mostly paths, fix-summary has command refs |
| Agent 3 | .opencode/skills/ | **32 COMMAND refs** - primary update target |
| Agent 4 | Root markdown | No matches |
| Agent 5 | JSON configs | Only path comments |
| Agent 6 | JavaScript src/ | No matches |
| Agent 7 | .opencode/command/ | 35+ files analyzed, command definitions |
| Agent 8 | .opencode/speckit/ | **2 COMMAND refs** updated |
| Agent 9 | z_install_guides/ | 34 occurrences, all paths |
| Agent 10 | Full workspace | Comprehensive verification |

---

## Verification

- [x] All `/memory/[command]` patterns changed to `/memory:[command]`
- [x] No file paths accidentally modified
- [x] AGENTS.md already uses colon notation (verified)
- [x] Total commands updated: **51** (18 external + 33 internal)

---

## Files NOT Requiring Changes

The following contained `/memory/` but were PATH references (correctly unchanged):

- `z_install_guides/MCP - Semantic Memory.md` - 34 path references
- `specs/005-memory/*/memory/*.md` - Historical documentation
- `.opencode/command/memory/*.md` - Command definition folder paths
- All `*.json` config files - Database path comments only
