# Feature Specification: Script Analysis Testing - End-to-End Workflow Validation

Complete feature specification defining the end-to-end testing requirements for the Spec Kit Memory workflow.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Spec
- **Level**: 2
- **Tags**: workflow-testing, memory-system, spec-kit
- **Priority**: P1
- **Feature Branch**: `053-script-analysis-testing`
- **Created**: 2025-12-31
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Input**: User request to test complete "Routine Spec Kit & Memory Save workflow" end-to-end

### Stakeholders
- Development team (primary)
- Future AI assistants (documentation consumers)

### Problem Statement
The Spec Kit Memory workflow involves multiple interconnected components (gates, memory tools, generate-context.js script). Without end-to-end testing, we cannot verify that all components work together correctly and that the documented workflow in AGENTS.md is accurate.

### Purpose
Validate that the complete Spec Kit Memory workflow functions correctly from Gate 1 through memory save and completion verification, ensuring all documented steps produce expected results.

### Assumptions
- All MCP servers are running and functional
- generate-context.js script is properly installed and configured
- Memory database is accessible and initialized

---

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Testing Gate 1: Understanding + Context Surfacing (memory_match_triggers)
- Testing Gate 2: Skill Routing (skill_advisor.py)
- Testing Gate 3: Spec Folder Question (verification)
- Testing Memory Context Loading (memory_search)
- Testing Memory Save Workflow (generate-context.js)
- Testing Completion Verification (checklist validation)

### Out of Scope
- Fixing any bugs found (separate spec folder for fixes)
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX improvements

---

## 3. USERS & STORIES

### User Story 1 - Workflow Validation (Priority: P0)

As a developer, I need to verify that the complete Spec Kit Memory workflow functions correctly so that I can trust the documented process in AGENTS.md.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because workflow correctness is fundamental to all future spec folder work.

**Independent Test**: Each gate/step can be tested independently and produces verifiable output.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** a user prompt, **When** memory_match_triggers is called, **Then** relevant memories are surfaced
2. **Given** a task description, **When** skill_advisor.py is run, **Then** appropriate skill recommendations are returned
3. **Given** a spec folder path, **When** generate-context.js is executed, **Then** a memory file is created in the memory/ subfolder

---

## 4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- **REQ-FUNC-001:** System MUST surface relevant context via memory_match_triggers for valid prompts
- **REQ-FUNC-002:** System MUST recommend appropriate skills via skill_advisor.py
- **REQ-FUNC-003:** System MUST allow memory search with specFolder and includeContent parameters
- **REQ-FUNC-004:** System MUST create memory files via generate-context.js in correct location
- **REQ-FUNC-005:** System MUST auto-index newly created memory files

### Traceability Mapping

| User Story | Related Requirements | Notes |
|------------|---------------------|-------|
| Story 1 - Workflow Validation | REQ-FUNC-001 through REQ-FUNC-005 | All requirements support validation |

---

## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All 6 workflow steps execute without errors
- **SC-002**: Memory file created in correct location with valid ANCHOR format
- **SC-003**: Auto-indexing occurs after memory save
- **SC-004**: Checklist can be loaded and verified
