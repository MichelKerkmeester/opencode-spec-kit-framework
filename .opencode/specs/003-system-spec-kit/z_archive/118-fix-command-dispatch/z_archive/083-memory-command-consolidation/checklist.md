## Verification Commands (All Passed)

```bash
# Count commands after consolidation
ls -la .opencode/command/memory/*.md | wc -l
# Result: 5 ✅

# Verify no deprecated files remain
ls .opencode/command/memory/ | grep -E "(search|database|checkpoint|why|correct)"
# Result: No output ✅

# Verify no why references in command folder
grep -r "memory:why" .opencode/command/memory/
# Result: No output ✅

# Verify MCP tool names correct
grep -r "memory_drift_context" .opencode/
# Result: No output ✅

# Verify memory_drift_learn removed
grep -r "memory_drift_learn" .opencode/
# Result: No output ✅
```

## Final Command Structure 

After consolidation, the following 5 commands exist:

```
.opencode/command/memory/
├── context.md     ✅ (unified retrieval, absorbed search)
├── continue.md    ✅ (session recovery)
├── learn.md       ✅ (feedback + correct/undo/history subcommands)
├── manage.md      ✅ (admin + checkpoint subcommands)
└── save.md        ✅ (persistence)
```
