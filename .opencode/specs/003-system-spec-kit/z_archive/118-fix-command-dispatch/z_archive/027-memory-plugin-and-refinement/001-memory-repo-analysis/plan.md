# Implementation Plan: Roampal Analysis - Technical Approach & Architecture

Research plan defining the analysis approach, deliverables, and execution strategy for comparing system-memory with roampal-core.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: plan | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Research Plan
- **Tags**: memory-system, roampal, architecture-analysis, semantic-search
- **Priority**: P1-high - core improvement research
- **Branch**: N/A (research task, no code changes)
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Spec**: `specs/005-memory/015-roampal-analysis/spec.md`

### Input
Feature specification from `/specs/005-memory/015-roampal-analysis/spec.md`

### Summary
Conduct comprehensive comparative analysis between our system-memory skill (v11.2.0) and roampal-core to identify improvement opportunities. The research will analyze both architectures, identify capability gaps, and produce prioritized recommendations for future implementation. This is a research-only effort with no code changes.

### Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: N/A (research/documentation task)
- **Primary Dependencies**: system-memory skill, roampal-core repository analysis
- **Storage**: N/A - analysis of existing SQLite (our system) vs ChromaDB (roampal)
- **Testing**: Manual validation of analysis completeness
- **Target Platform**: Documentation artifacts
- **Project Type**: Research analysis (document-only output)
- **Performance Goals**: N/A (not performance-critical)
- **Constraints**: Time-boxed research, no implementation scope creep
- **Scale/Scope**: 2 systems, ~30 features to compare, 4-5 deliverable documents

---

## 2. QUALITY GATES

**GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.**

### Definition of Ready (DoR)
- [x] Problem statement clear; scope documented
- [x] Stakeholders identified; decisions path agreed
- [x] Constraints known; risks captured
- [x] Success criteria measurable

### Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met; documents complete
- [ ] Docs updated (spec/plan/tasks/checklist/decision-record)
- [ ] All analysis findings documented with citations
- [ ] Recommendations validated for feasibility

### Rollback Guardrails
- **Stop Signals**: Research scope expanding into implementation, diminishing returns on analysis depth
- **Recovery Procedure**: Checkpoint current findings, reassess scope, document partial results

### Constitution Check (Complexity Tracking)

No complexity violations - this is a documentation/research effort with no code artifacts.

## 4A. OPENCODE HOOK ANALYSIS FINDINGS

### Analysis Completed: 2025-12-17

**Key Discovery**: OpenCode provides partial hook support - sufficient for a hybrid approach but not direct roampal-style hooks.

### OpenCode Capabilities Confirmed

| Capability | Available | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `session.created` event | ✅ Yes | Plugin can inject context at session start |
| `session.idle` event | ✅ Yes | Can record exchanges during idle periods |
| `tool.execute.before/after` | ✅ Yes | Can intercept tool calls |
| `session.prompt()` with `noReply:true` | ✅ Yes | Can inject messages without expecting response |
| `session.prompt.before` (message interception) | ❌ No | Cannot intercept user messages before AI sees them |

### Hybrid 3-Layer Strategy

Since direct per-message hooks aren't available, we designed a hybrid approach:

**Layer 1: Session Start Injection (Plugin)**
- Trigger: `session.created` event
- Action: Inject constitutional memories + user profile (~500 tokens)
- Implementation: `.opencode/plugin/memory-context.js`

**Layer 2: Mandatory Trigger Matching (AGENTS.md)**
- Trigger: Every user message (soft enforcement via agent instructions)
- Action: AI calls `memory_match_triggers()` as first action
- Implementation: Update AGENTS.md Gate 3 / Phase 2

**Layer 3: Exchange Recording (Plugin)**
- Trigger: `session.idle` event
- Action: Record significant exchanges to working memory
- Implementation: `.opencode/plugin/memory-context.js`

### Revised Implementation Approach

The original plan to "defer hooks" (ADR-002) is now updated to "implement hybrid approach" since OpenCode provides sufficient building blocks for ~70% of roampal's automatic context injection value.

## 5. TESTING STRATEGY

### Validation Approach

For research tasks, testing is replaced by validation checkpoints:

```
        /\
       /REV\      <- Final stakeholder review
      /------\
     / SELF   \   <- Self-review for completeness
    /----------\
   / CHECKLIST  \  <- Checklist verification (foundation)
  /--------------\
```

### Checklist Verification
- **Scope**: All Phase deliverables
- **Tools**: Manual checklist.md review
- **Coverage Target**: 100% of acceptance criteria
- **Execution**: After each phase completion

### Self-Review
- **Scope**: Document quality, citation accuracy
- **Tools**: Manual review against spec requirements
- **Coverage Target**: All documents
- **Execution**: Before final delivery

### Final Review
- **Scope**: Complete research package
- **Tools**: Stakeholder walkthrough
- **Coverage Target**: All recommendations validated
- **Execution**: Post-Phase 3 completion

### CI Quality Gates

- [ ] All checklist items marked complete
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All recommendations have feasibility assessments
- [ ] Decision record created (Level 3 requirement)
- [ ] No unresolved questions/blockers

### Rollback Plan

- **Rollback Trigger**: Research taking >2x estimated time, blockers preventing progress
- **Rollback Procedure**:
  1. Document current findings in scratch/
  2. Create partial recommendations document
  3. Note incomplete areas for future research
- **Data Migration Reversal**: N/A (no data changes)
- **Verification**: Confirm all partial findings are preserved
