# Feature Specification: Memory Plugin Dashboard Optimization - Requirements & User Stories

Optimize the semantic memory plugin to inject a compact "memory dashboard" instead of full content, reducing token consumption while maintaining context visibility.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Enhancement
- **Tags**: memory, plugin, optimization, dashboard
- **Priority**: P1
- **Feature Branch**: `015-memory-plugin-and-refinement`
- **Created**: 2025-12-17
- **Status**: Approved
- **Input**: User-approved dashboard design for compact memory context injection

### Stakeholders
- AI Agent (primary consumer of injected context)
- Developer (maintains plugin code)

### Purpose
Reduce token consumption from ~2,000-5,000 tokens to ~500-1,000 tokens per session by replacing full memory content injection with a compact ASCII dashboard that surfaces memory IDs for on-demand loading.

### Assumptions

- Plugin architecture supports custom transform hooks via `experimental.chat.system.transform`
- SQLite database with semantic memory tables exists at `.opencode/skills/system-memory/database/memory-index.sqlite`
- Memory records have `importance_tier`, `title`, `trigger_phrases`, `created_at`, and `spec_folder` fields
- Dashboard format approved by user (see Section 4 for exact format)

**Assumptions Validation Checklist**:
- [x] All assumptions reviewed with stakeholders
- [x] Technical feasibility verified for each assumption
- [x] Risk assessment completed for critical assumptions
- [x] Fallback plans identified for uncertain assumptions

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope
- New `getMemoryIndex()` function to query constitutional + critical + recent memories
- New `formatMemoryDashboard()` function to create ASCII dashboard output
- Helper `formatTimeAgo()` for human-readable timestamps ("1h ago", "2d ago")
- Helper `truncateTriggers()` to limit trigger phrases to 3-4 items
- Update configuration constants for memory limits
- Update `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook integration

### Out of Scope
- Changes to semantic memory MCP server - uses existing query capabilities
- New database schema or indexes - works with existing structure
- Memory search improvements - separate enhancement
- Dashboard interactivity - static ASCII output only

---

## 3. USERS & STORIES

### User Story 1 - Compact Context Injection (Priority: P0)

As an AI agent, I need a compact memory dashboard injected at session start so that I can see available context without consuming excessive tokens.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because this is the core purpose of the optimization - without it, the plugin continues consuming 2,000-5,000 tokens.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the transform hook produces the expected ASCII dashboard format with correct memory counts and IDs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** session starts with memories in database, **When** transform hook executes, **Then** dashboard shows constitutional/critical/recent memories in approved format
2. **Given** session starts with empty database, **When** transform hook executes, **Then** dashboard shows "No memories found" message
3. **Given** memories exist but some tiers are empty, **When** transform hook executes, **Then** empty sections are hidden (not shown as "None")

---

### User Story 2 - Memory ID Discovery (Priority: P0)

As an AI agent, I need to see memory IDs in the dashboard so that I can load specific memories on-demand using `memory_load({ memoryId: # })`.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because the dashboard is useless without actionable memory IDs for loading full content.

**Independent Test**: Verify each memory entry in dashboard includes its numeric ID in the format `#39 │ Title`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** dashboard displays memories, **When** agent sees memory `#39`, **Then** agent can call `memory_load({ memoryId: 39 })` to retrieve full content
2. **Given** dashboard footer is displayed, **When** agent reads instructions, **Then** footer shows correct command syntax for LOAD and SEARCH

---

### User Story 3 - Token Budget Compliance (Priority: P1)

As a system administrator, I need the dashboard to stay within 500-1,000 tokens so that context injection doesn't impact agent performance.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because staying under budget is the key optimization goal.

**Independent Test**: Measure token count of generated dashboard with maximum memories (14 entries) and verify < 1,000 tokens.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** maximum memories displayed (3 constitutional + 3 critical + 3 important + 5 recent), **When** dashboard is generated, **Then** total output is < 1,000 tokens
2. **Given** only title is used for summaries, **When** dashboard is generated, **Then** no separate summary field is queried or displayed

### Requirements

- **REQ-FUNC-001:** System MUST query memories by importance tier (constitutional, critical, important, recent)
- **REQ-FUNC-002:** System MUST display memory ID, title, spec folder, and trigger phrases for each entry
- **REQ-FUNC-003:** System MUST show relative timestamps ("1h ago", "2d ago") for non-constitutional memories

- **NFR-R01**: Plugin MUST gracefully handle database connection failures
- **NFR-R02**: Plugin MUST return empty dashboard (not error) if no memories exist
- **NFR-R03**: Plugin MUST not block session start on query failures

### Maintainability

- **NFR-M01**: Memory limits MUST be configurable via constants
- **NFR-M02**: Dashboard format MUST be modular (separate format function)
- **NFR-M03**: Time formatting MUST be in dedicated helper function

## 6. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- What happens when no memories exist? → Show "No memories found" message
- What happens when only constitutional memories exist? → Show constitutional section only
- What happens when trigger phrases are empty? → Hide trigger line for that entry

### Error Scenarios
- What happens when database is locked? → Return empty dashboard, log warning
- What happens when database file doesn't exist? → Return empty dashboard, log info
- What happens when query times out? → Return empty dashboard after 5s timeout

### State Transitions
- What happens when memories are added mid-session? → Dashboard is generated once at session start (static)
- What happens when memory is deleted after dashboard shown? → Agent may get "not found" on load (acceptable)

---

## 7. SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Dashboard token count < 1,000 tokens with 14 memories
- **SC-002**: Dashboard generation time < 100ms
- **SC-003**: Zero errors in production for first 100 sessions
- **SC-004**: Agent can successfully load memories using displayed IDs

### KPI Targets

| Category | Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Performance | Token reduction | 75-90% | Compare before/after injection size |
| Quality | P0/P1 defects | 0 within 7 days | Manual testing |
| Usability | Memory load success rate | 100% | Test with displayed IDs |

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Owner | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| Semantic Memory SQLite DB | Internal | Memory System | Green | Cannot query memories |
| OpenCode Plugin System | Internal | OpenCode | Green | Cannot inject dashboard |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| R-001 | Database schema changes break queries | High | Low | Pin to known schema version | Developer |
| R-002 | Token count exceeds budget | Med | Low | Test with max memories, add truncation | Developer |

### Rollback Plan

- **Rollback Trigger**: Dashboard causes session start failures or token budget exceeded by >50%
- **Rollback Procedure**:
  1. Comment out transform hook in plugin
  2. Restart OpenCode
  3. Verify sessions start normally
- **Verification**: Session starts without injected context

---

## 9. OUT OF SCOPE

**Explicit Exclusions**:

- MCP server modifications - uses existing query capabilities
- Database schema changes - works with current structure
- Real-time dashboard updates - static at session start
- Dashboard styling/colors - ASCII only
- Memory priority scoring changes - uses existing tier system
