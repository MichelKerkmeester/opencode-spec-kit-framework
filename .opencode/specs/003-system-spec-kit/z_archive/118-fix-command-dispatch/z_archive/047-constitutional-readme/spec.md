## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- Create README.md in the constitutional/ directory
- Document the constitutional tier behavior (always surfaces, 3.0x boost, no decay)
- Explain YAML frontmatter requirements
- Provide templates for creating new constitutional memories
- Document trigger phrase configuration
- Include troubleshooting section

### Out of Scope

- Modifying existing constitutional memories
- Changes to the MCP server code
- Changes to the importance tier system

---

## 3. Success Criteria

- [x] README.md created in constitutional/ directory
- [x] Follows established README patterns from other skill folders
- [x] Includes TABLE OF CONTENTS with numbered sections
- [x] Documents all required frontmatter fields
