## 1. Technical Approach

### Research Phase

1. Analyze existing READMEs in the skill folder to understand patterns:
   - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md` (1887 lines)
   - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md` (396 lines)
   - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/README.md` (483 lines)
   - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/lib/README.md` (355 lines)
   - `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/README.md` (477 lines)

2. Examine constitutional folder contents:
   - `gate-enforcement.md` - existing constitutional memory

3. Understand constitutional tier from prior analysis:
   - 3.0x search boost
   - Never decays
   - ~500 token budget
   - Always surfaces at top of search results

### Implementation Phase

Create README.md with sections:
1. Overview - What constitutional memories are
2. Quick Start - 30-second setup
3. Structure - Directory layout
4. Features - Always-surface, triggers, ANCHOR format
5. Configuration - YAML frontmatter requirements
6. Creating - Step-by-step guide with template
7. Customization - Adding triggers, modifying rules
8. Examples - Real-world usage
9. Troubleshooting - Common issues
10. Related Documents - Links
