<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~500 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**What Was Built**:

- **Completed post-fix verification and remediation for the UX Deep Analysis project. Initial...** - Completed post-fix verification and remediation for the UX Deep Analysis project.

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Previous 10-agent fix session claimed completion but many fixes were not actually applied - possibly due to agent execution issues or incomplete tool calls; solution: Ran thorough verification using Sequential Thinking MCP, identified all remaining issues via grep searches, deployed 5 targeted agents to fix specific issue categories, then ran final verification sweep; patterns: Verification-first approach: Always grep/search to confirm fixes before claiming completion.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode/command/spec_kit/resume.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/command/create/assets/create_skill.yaml` - Core create skill

- `.opencode/.../assets/spec_kit_research_confirm.yaml` - Core spec kit research confirm

- `.opencode/.../assets/spec_kit_research_auto.yaml` - Core spec kit research auto

- `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_plan_confirm.yaml` - Core spec kit plan confirm

- `.opencode/command/spec_kit/assets/spec_kit_plan_auto.yaml` - Core spec kit plan auto

- `.opencode/.../assets/spec_kit_complete_confirm.yaml` - Core spec kit complete confirm

- `.opencode/.../assets/spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml` - Core spec kit complete auto

**How to Extend**:

- Follow the established API pattern for new endpoints

- Use established template patterns for new outputs

**Common Patterns**:

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Data Normalization**: Clean and standardize data before use

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed post-fix verification and remediation for the UX Deep Analysis project. Initial verification revealed that many claimed fixes from the previous session were NOT actually applied - found 14 files still containing incorrect mcp__semantic_memory__ prefix, 1 file with wrong decay formula, AGENTS UNIVERSAL with wrong leann_ask, and 2 missing files (command/README.md and memory/load.md). Deployed 5 Opus agents to fix all remaining issues: Agent 1 fixed all 14 MCP tool naming issues across YAML and MD files, Agent 2 fixed decay formula and path references, Agent 3 created the command discovery index README, Agent 4 created the memory/load.md command, and Agent 5 performed final verification confirming all fixes applied correctly. System is now verified READY FOR PUBLIC.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Completed post-fix verification and remediation for the UX Deep Analysis project. Initial...
- Decision: Used 5 parallel Opus agents instead of 20 because previous 20-agent at
- Decision: Fixed template count from 14 to 13 during verification - the contracts
- Decision: Created memory/load.
- Decision: Command README.
- Technical Implementation Details

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Previous 10-agent fix session claimed completion but many fixes were not actually applied - possibly due to agent execution issues or incomplete tool calls; solution: Ran thorough verification using Sequential Thinking MCP, identified all remaining issues via grep searches, deployed 5 targeted agents to fix specific issue categories, then ran final verification sweep; patterns: Verification-first approach: Always grep/search to confirm fixes before claiming completion. Batch agent deployments in smaller groups (5 vs 20) to avoid rate limiting.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-memory-and-spec-kit/033-ux-deep-analysis` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-memory-and-spec-kit/033-ux-deep-analysis" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
