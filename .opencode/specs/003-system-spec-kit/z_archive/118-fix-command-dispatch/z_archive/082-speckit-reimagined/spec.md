## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

SpecKit Reimagined synthesizes findings from 25 parallel agent analyses of 8 pre-analysis documents examining dotmd, seu-claude, drift, and system-speckit architectures. This specification defines 15 P0 blockers (10 original + 5 embedding resilience), 18 P1 requirements, and establishes a unified 6-7 week implementation roadmap to transform SpecKit into a best-in-class memory system with hybrid search, causal graphs, embedding resilience, and self-improvement capabilities.

> **[AUDIT 2026-02-01]:** Timeline corrected from 11 weeks to 6-7 weeks based on critical path analysis. Original estimate included redundant parallel work (Wave 3 could leverage foundations from Waves 1-2) and overestimated dependencies. RRF fusion, composite scoring, and FSRS already exist in codebase, reducing new implementation effort. See tasks.md for detailed breakdown.

**Key Decisions**: Adopt drift's session deduplication + type-specific half-lives, enhance dotmd's RRF fusion with convergence bonus, maintain SpecKit's ANCHOR format for token efficiency, and implement defense-in-depth embedding resilience (ADR-009).

**Critical Dependencies**: Session deduplication (blocks token savings), causal graph (prerequisite for "why" queries), embedding fallback chain (blocks memory save reliability). Note: Lazy loading and RRF fusion foundations already exist in codebase.

## 1. METADATA

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Level** | 3+ |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Created** | 2026-02-01 |
| **Branch** | `082-speckit-reimagined` |

---

## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement

SpecKit currently lacks critical capabilities present in competitor systems: no graph traversal (dotmd has 2-hop + LadybugDB), no session deduplication (drift achieves 8-16x token savings), no type-specific memory half-lives (drift has 9 types), and no causal relationship tracking (drift has 8 relationship types). These gaps result in 25-35% excess token usage and inability to answer "why" queries about decision lineage.

**Current State (validated via codebase analysis):**
- Lazy embedding provider EXISTS (`shared/embeddings.js` singleton pattern), but uses eager warmup
- RRF fusion EXISTS (`lib/search/rrf-fusion.js`), but needs enhancement for convergence bonus
- Hybrid search with FTS5 EXISTS (`lib/search/hybrid-search.js`)
- Composite scoring EXISTS with 6 factors (`lib/scoring/composite-scoring.js`)
- FSRS integration EXISTS (`lib/cognitive/attention-decay.js`)

**Gaps requiring new implementation:**
- Session deduplication (no current implementation)
- Type-specific half-lives (column exists but no type inference)
- Causal graph relationships (no current implementation)
- 5-state memory model (thresholds not yet defined)
- Recovery hints catalog (error handling is basic)

### Purpose

Transform SpecKit into a self-improving memory system with hybrid search (vector + BM25 + graph), session deduplication, causal lineage tracking, and multi-factor decay scoring, achieving 40-50% relevance improvement and 50% token reduction on follow-up queries.

---

## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope

- P0: Session deduplication, type-specific half-lives, lazy model loading, recovery hints, usage boost, intent-aware retrieval, tool output caching
- P0 (new): Length penalty in reranking, recovery hints catalog, 5-state memory model
- P1: RRF search fusion, causal memory graph, cross-encoder reranking, BM25 hybrid search, learning from corrections, crash recovery, multi-factor decay, query expansion, standardized response structure, layered tool organization, protocol abstractions, consolidation pipeline
- P1 (new): Incremental indexing, pre-flight quality gates, CONTINUE_SESSION.md, corrections tracking, fuzzy acronym matching, BM25-WASM
- Migration strategy with feature flags for non-breaking deployment

### Out of Scope

- Full hexagonal architecture (P3 - over-engineering for current scale)
- Graph database migration to LadybugDB (only if >10K nodes)
- Self-correction learning (P4 - LOW impact, HIGH effort)
- Per-layer token budgets (P2 - after layered tools complete)

## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Risk | R1: Cross-encoder latency/cost | Medium | Optional, limit to 20 candidates, cache results |
| Risk | R2: Cache invalidation bugs | High | Conservative 60s TTL, invalidate on write |
| Risk | R3: Half-life misconfiguration | High | Document defaults, provide reset command, dry-run mode |
| Risk | R4: RRF tuning complexity | Medium | Ship with k=60 default, iterate post-baseline |
| Risk | R5: Graph scaling beyond 10K nodes | Medium | Index heavily, consider LadybugDB migration path |
| Risk | R6: Learning system errors/bias | Medium | Feature flag, allow undo of corrections |
| Risk | R7: Session state overhead | Low | 30min TTL, cap at 100 entries per session |
| Risk | R8: Breaking changes in schema v5 | Medium | Version schema, defaults preserve compatibility |
| Dependency | Lazy model loading | Blocks MCP cold-start improvement | Prioritize in Phase 1 |
| Dependency | RRF implementation | Required before cross-encoder reranking | Phase 2 prerequisite |
| Dependency | Type-specific half-lives | Required before multi-factor decay | Phase 1 then Phase 2 |

---

## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance

- **NFR-P01**: MCP startup time <500ms (cold start)
- **NFR-P02**: Query latency P95 <150ms
- **NFR-P03**: Cross-encoder reranking P95 <500ms (or disable)

### Security

- **NFR-S01**: No secrets in memory content (validation gate)
- **NFR-S02**: Session isolation (no cross-session data leakage)

### Reliability

- **NFR-R01**: Zero data loss on crash (immediate SQLite saves)
- **NFR-R02**: Graceful degradation when embedding API unavailable
- **NFR-R03**: Embedding provider failures must not block memory saves; deferred indexing with `embedding_status: 'pending'`
- **NFR-R04**: API key validation at startup with actionable error messages; fail-fast on invalid credentials
- **NFR-R05**: Fallback chain must complete within 100ms of primary failure detection; no cascading delays

---

## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries

- Empty query: Return top memories by attention score
- Query >10000 chars: Return E040 error with truncation hint
- Zero search results: Suggest query expansion or broader anchors

### Error Scenarios

- Embedding API failure: Fall back to BM25-only search
- Cross-encoder timeout: Skip reranking, return RRF results
- Database corruption: Restore from checkpoint, warn user

### Embedding Provider Edge Cases

- **Invalid API key at startup**: MCP startup fails with E050 error; actionable message: "Embedding API key invalid. Verify key with your provider (e.g., voyage.ai/dashboard, openai.com/api-keys)"
- **Invalid API key at runtime**: Trigger fallback chain immediately; log warning with E051 code
- **All providers fail**: Save memory file with `embedding_status: 'failed'`; searchable via BM25; surface warning in memory_save response
- **Local model unavailable**: Skip to BM25-only mode; log E052 with instructions for installing nomic-embed-text
- **Partial embedding failure**: Retry failed chunks up to 3x; if still failing, save with `embedding_status: 'partial'`
- **Network timeout during embedding**: Apply 30s timeout per request; trigger fallback after 2 consecutive timeouts

---

## 9. COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

| Dimension | Score | Triggers |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Scope | 22/25 | Files: 15+, LOC: 2000+, Systems: 4 (search, decay, session, graph) |

| Research | 18/20 | 8 source documents, 25-agent analysis, 4 competitor systems |
| Multi-Agent | 12/15 | Workstreams: 3 (search, decay, persistence) |
| Coordination | 13/15 | Dependencies: 5 (RRF→rerank, types→decay, lazy→startup, etc.) |
| **Total** | **85/100** | **Level 3+ justified** |

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Session Deduplication (Priority: P0)

**As a** developer using SpecKit, **I want** memories already surfaced in this session to not repeat, **so that** I save tokens and avoid redundant context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a session with 5 surfaced memories, When I search again, Then those 5 are excluded from results
2. Given deduplication enabled, When a follow-up query runs, Then token count is reduced by ~50%

### US-002: Causal Lineage Query (Priority: P1)

**As a** developer debugging a decision, **I want** to trace why a memory was created, **so that** I understand the decision history.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a memory with causal links, When I call `memory_drift_why(id)`, Then I see caused_by, enabled_by, supersedes relationships
2. Given max depth of 3, When causal chain exceeds 3 hops, Then traversal stops and indicates maxDepthReached
