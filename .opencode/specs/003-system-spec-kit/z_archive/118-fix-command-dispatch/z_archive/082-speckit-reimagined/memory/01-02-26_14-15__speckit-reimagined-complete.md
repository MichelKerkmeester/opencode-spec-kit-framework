<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):

  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })

  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier

  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({
       id: <memory_id>,
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })

  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. OVERVIEW

SpecKit Reimagined implementation complete. 107/107 tasks finished via 28 parallel Opus 4.5 agents across 5 workstreams: W-S (Session Management), W-R (Search/Retrieval), W-D (Decay & Scoring), W-G (Graph/Relations), W-I (Infrastructure). System now features session deduplication, 9 memory types with type-specific half-lives, causal memory graph with 6 relation types, 5-state memory model, crash recovery, and 5 new commands.

**Key Outcomes**:
- 107/107 tasks complete across 5 workstreams
- 28 parallel Opus 4.5 agents used for implementation
- 5 new commands added: /memory:continue, /memory:context, /memory:why, /memory:correct, /memory:learn
- 22 MCP handlers with 7-layer architecture
- 9 memory types with type-specific half-lives
- 6 causal relation types
- 400+ tests passing
- Template v2.2 with CONTINUE_SESSION, session_dedup, causal_links

**Workstream Breakdown**:
- **W-S (Session Management)**: Session deduplication (T001-T004), crash recovery (T071-T075), template updates (T108-T113)
- **W-R (Search/Retrieval)**: BM25 hybrid search (T028-T031), intent-aware retrieval (T036-T039), cross-encoder reranking (T048-T051), fuzzy matching (T076-T078)
- **W-D (Decay & Scoring)**: Type-specific half-lives (T005-T008), multi-factor decay (T032-T035), 5-state memory model (T056-T059), consolidation (T079-T083)
- **W-G (Graph/Relations)**: Causal memory graph (T043-T047), learning from corrections (T052-T055)
- **W-I (Infrastructure)**: Recovery hints (T009-T011), response envelope (T040-T042), 7-layer architecture (T060-T063), embedding resilience (T087-T107), new commands (T118-T122)

## 2. DECISIONS

Key architectural decisions made during this implementation:

| # | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|---|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Used 28 parallel Opus agents | Complex implementation required specialized focus per workstream | Enabled parallel development, faster completion |
| 2 | Implemented 7-layer MCP architecture | Token budgets per layer enable progressive disclosure | Improved token efficiency, better context management |
| 3 | Added 5 new commands | Unified entry points improve UX vs raw MCP tools | Better developer experience, consistent interface |
| 4 | Used session deduplication with SHA-256 hashing | Achieves ~50% token reduction on follow-up queries | Significant token savings, faster responses |
| 5 | FSRS-based decay formula with type-specific half-lives | Different memory types need different retention periods | More intelligent memory management |

## 3. TECHNICAL CONTEXT

This was a Level 3+ spec (complexity 85/100) transforming SpecKit from basic context storage to an intelligent self-improving memory system. Implementation used parallel agent delegation pattern with standardized response envelopes and embedding fallback chains.

**Root Cause**: SpecKit needed transformation from basic context storage to intelligent self-improving system

**Solution**: Implemented 5 workstreams covering:
1. Session management (deduplication, crash recovery)
2. Search/retrieval (BM25 hybrid, cross-encoder reranking)
3. Decay/scoring (type-specific half-lives, 5-state model)
4. Graph relations (causal memory graph, learning from corrections)
5. Infrastructure (7-layer architecture, embedding resilience)

**Patterns Used**:
- Parallel agent delegation
- Standardized response envelope
- Embedding fallback chain
- FSRS decay formula
