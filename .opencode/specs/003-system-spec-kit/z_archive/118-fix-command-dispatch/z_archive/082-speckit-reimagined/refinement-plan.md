# 082 Refinement Implementation Plan

> **Created:** 2026-02-01  
> **Purpose:** Detailed refinement actions to address documentation issues identified in comprehensive review  
> **Status:** PLAN ONLY - Do not execute without approval

---

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses 13 issues identified during comprehensive review:
- **5 P0 (High Priority):** Research accuracy, timeline, critical path, HALT conditions, evidence framework
- **5 P1 (Medium Priority):** P0 reclassification, memory density, agent assignments, skill triggers, template compliance
- **3 P2 (Low Priority):** Novel patterns, extra files, learning metrics

**Note:** Several P0 issues (REF-001, REF-002, REF-003) are ALREADY PARTIALLY ADDRESSED by existing audit notes in tasks.md and corrections in feature-summary.md. This plan validates and completes those fixes.

---

## Refinement Actions

### REF-001: Correct RRF/FSRS Implementation Status (P0)

**Issue:** Research methodology failed to verify existing implementations - RRF fusion, FSRS decay, composite scoring marked as gaps when they ALREADY EXIST.

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY CORRECTED in feature-summary.md (lines 22-27, 172-173, 197-199)

**Verification Required:**
```bash
# Verify these files exist in codebase:
ls -la .claude/skills/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/search/rrf-fusion.js
ls -la .claude/skills/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/scoring/composite-scoring.js
ls -la .claude/skills/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/cognitive/tier-classifier.js
```

**Existing Corrections in feature-summary.md:**
- Feature 1 (RRF): Line 24-25 - "SpecKit has `mcp_server/lib/search/rrf-fusion.js` with k=60 and 10% convergence bonus already implemented"
- Feature 8 (Composite): Line 172-173 - "SpecKit has `mcp_server/lib/scoring/composite-scoring.js` with 6 factors already implemented"
- Feature 9 (5-State): Line 197-199 - "SpecKit has `mcp_server/lib/cognitive/tier-classifier.js` with 5 states already implemented"

**Additional Action Needed:** Add explicit file path references to spec.md Section 2 (Problem Statement)

**File:** spec.md
**Location:** Lines 36-48 (Current State section)
**Current Text (already present):**
```markdown
**Current State (validated via codebase analysis):**
- Lazy embedding provider EXISTS (`shared/embeddings.js` singleton pattern), but uses eager warmup
- RRF fusion EXISTS (`lib/search/rrf-fusion.js`), but needs enhancement for convergence bonus
- Hybrid search with FTS5 EXISTS (`lib/search/hybrid-search.js`)
- Composite scoring EXISTS with 6 factors (`lib/scoring/composite-scoring.js`)
- FSRS integration EXISTS (`lib/cognitive/attention-decay.js`)
```

**Status:** ✅ No change needed - already accurate

**Validation:** 
- [x] File paths verified in codebase (confirmed via glob)
- [x] feature-summary.md corrections present
- [x] spec.md Current State section accurate

---

### REF-002: Reconcile Timeline (P0)

**Issue:** Timeline inconsistency across documents (6-7, 8.5, 11 weeks mentioned in different places)

**Files Affected:**
1. spec.md - Line 10: "11-week implementation roadmap"
2. plan.md - Line 21: "4-phase approach across 11 weeks"
3. plan.md - Line 245-246: "~8.5 weeks" and note about 6-7 weeks
4. tasks.md - Line 35: "~6-7 weeks (not 11)"
5. implementation-summary.md - Line 17: "~6-7 week revised timeline"

**Root Cause:** Original estimate was 11 weeks, then revised to 8.5 weeks after discovering existing implementations, then further revised to 6-7 weeks.

**Recommended Resolution:** Standardize to **6-7 weeks** based on existing implementations.

**Specific Changes:**

**File:** spec.md  
**Line:** 10  
**Action:** Update executive summary
```markdown
- This specification defines 15 P0 blockers (10 original + 5 embedding resilience), 18 P1 requirements, and establishes a unified 11-week implementation roadmap to transform SpecKit...
+ This specification defines 15 P0 blockers (10 original + 5 embedding resilience), 18 P1 requirements, and establishes a unified 6-7 week implementation roadmap to transform SpecKit...
```

**File:** plan.md  
**Line:** 21  
**Action:** Update overview
```markdown
- This plan implements a comprehensive enhancement to SpecKit's memory system based on consolidated analysis of dotmd, seu-claude, drift, and system-speckit architectures. The implementation follows a 4-phase approach across 11 weeks, introducing session deduplication...

```

**File:** plan.md  
**Line:** 245-246  
**Action:** Update effort table to be consistent
```markdown
| **Total** | | | **~8.5 weeks** |

> **Note:** Timeline revised from ~11 weeks to ~8.5 weeks accounting for existing implementations found (RRF, composite, FSRS, 5-state) during codebase analysis.
```
**Replace with:**
```markdown
| **Total** | | | **~6-7 weeks** |

> **Note:** Timeline revised from original ~11 weeks to ~6-7 weeks accounting for existing implementations (RRF fusion, composite scoring with 6 factors, FSRS scheduler, 5-state tier classifier) discovered during codebase analysis. The 8.5-week intermediate estimate has been further reduced as implementation scope is now well-understood.
```

**Validation:** 
```bash
# Search all docs for week references
grep -rn "week" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/ --include="*.md"
```

---

### REF-003: Correct Critical Path Duration (P0)

**Issue:** Critical path overstated by ~11 days (28→17 days actual when considering parallel execution)

**File:** plan.md  
**Location:** Lines 356-370 (L3: CRITICAL PATH section)

**Current Text:**
```markdown
## L3: CRITICAL PATH

1. **Type-Specific Half-Lives** - 2-3 hours - CRITICAL
2. **Multi-Factor Decay Composite** - 3 days - CRITICAL
3. **RRF Search Fusion** - 5 days - CRITICAL
4. **Causal Memory Graph** - 10 days - CRITICAL
5. **Learning from Corrections** - 7 days - CRITICAL

**Total Critical Path**: ~28 days

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Session Deduplication, Recovery Hints, Caching, Lazy Loading can run simultaneously (Week 1)
- RRF Fusion and BM25 can progress in parallel (Week 2)
- Cross-Encoder and Intent-Aware Retrieval can run after Phase 2 completes
```

**Analysis:**
- Type-Specific Half-Lives: 2-3 hours (but config exists, just needs type inference)
- Multi-Factor Decay: 3 days (but composite-scoring.js already has 6 factors)
- RRF Search Fusion: 5 days (but rrf-fusion.js already exists with k=60)
- Causal Memory Graph: 10 days (NEW - this is actual new work)
- Learning from Corrections: 7 days (depends on graph, but can start schema early)

**Revised Critical Path (considering existing implementations):**
1. Type-Specific Half-Lives: 1 day (add type inference, config exists)
2. Multi-Factor Decay: 1 day (enhance existing composite-scoring.js)
3. RRF Search Fusion: 2 days (enhance existing rrf-fusion.js)
4. Causal Memory Graph: 10 days (new table, traversal, tools)
5. Learning from Corrections: 3 days (schema + penalty application after graph)

**Specific Changes:**

**Replace lines 356-370 with:**
```markdown
## L3: CRITICAL PATH (Revised)

Based on codebase analysis confirming existing implementations:

| Item | Original Est. | Revised Est. | Reason |
|------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Type-Specific Half-Lives | 2-3 hours | 1 day | Config exists, add type inference only |
| Multi-Factor Decay | 3 days | 1 day | composite-scoring.js has 6 factors, minor enhancement |
| RRF Search Fusion | 5 days | 2 days | rrf-fusion.js exists with k=60, add graph integration |
| Causal Memory Graph | 10 days | 10 days | NEW - full implementation required |
| Learning from Corrections | 7 days | 3 days | Schema after graph, simpler than estimated |

**Total Critical Path**: ~17 days (revised from 28 days)

**Parallel Opportunities** (unchanged):
- Session Deduplication, Recovery Hints, Caching, Lazy Loading run simultaneously (Week 1)
- RRF Fusion enhancement and BM25 can progress in parallel (Week 2)
- Cross-Encoder and Intent-Aware Retrieval after Phase 2
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Math verified: 1+1+2+10+3 = 17 days
- [ ] Parallel execution paths documented
- [ ] Aligns with 6-7 week overall timeline

---

### REF-004: Add HALT Conditions (P0)

**Issue:** No HALT conditions or failure recovery protocol documented in AI Execution Protocol

**File:** tasks.md  
**Location:** After line 346 (after TASK-PARALLEL rule)

**Action:** Add TASK-HALT rule to Execution Rules table and add Failure Recovery section

**Specific Changes:**

**After line 346, add new row to Execution Rules table:**
```markdown
| TASK-HALT | Stop and escalate immediately if any halt condition is met (see below) |
```

**After line 347 (after table), add new section:**
```markdown

### HALT Conditions (TASK-HALT)

Stop immediately and escalate to user if ANY of the following occur:

| Condition | Example | Required Action |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Dependency task failed | T020 (RRF) failed, blocking T031 (BM25) | Report failure, suggest fix, wait for guidance |
| 3+ consecutive attempts failed | Same test failing after 3 fix attempts | Escalate with error log, try different approach only with approval |
| Acceptance criteria unclear | "Improve relevance" without measurable target | Request clarification before proceeding |
| Security concern identified | API key exposure, SQL injection risk | STOP immediately, report, do not commit |
| Out of scope change requested | Unrelated feature during bugfix | Reject, suggest new spec folder |
| Conflicting requirements | REQ-001 contradicts REQ-003 | Report conflict, request resolution |
| Breaking change without flag | Schema change without ENABLE_* flag | Add feature flag before proceeding |
```

**Validation:**
```bash
grep -n "TASK-HALT" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/tasks.md
```

---

### REF-005: Add Failure Recovery Protocol (P0)

**Issue:** No failure recovery protocol exists

**File:** tasks.md  
**Location:** After the HALT Conditions section added in REF-004

**Specific Changes:**

**Add after HALT Conditions:**
```markdown

### Failure Recovery Protocol (TASK-FAIL)

When a task fails, follow this recovery sequence:

```
FAILURE DETECTED
      ↓
1. CAPTURE: Log exact error, stack trace, and reproduction steps
      ↓
2. CATEGORIZE: Is this transient (retry) or permanent (fix)?
      ↓
   ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
   │ TRANSIENT   │ PERMANENT   │
   │ (5xx, timeout) │ (logic error) │
   └─────────────┴─────────────┘
      ↓               ↓
3. RETRY (max 3x)  3. INVESTIGATE
   with backoff       root cause
      ↓               ↓
4. Still failing?  4. Propose fix
   → Escalate         → Update task
      ↓               ↓
5. Wait for         5. Verify fix
   guidance            in isolation
```

**Recovery Actions by Error Type:**

| Error Type | Recovery Action | Max Attempts |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Test failure | Fix code, rerun tests | 3 |
| Build failure | Check dependencies, fix imports | 3 |
| API error (5xx) | Retry with backoff | 3 |
| API error (4xx) | Check credentials/params | 1 (fail fast) |
| Schema migration | Rollback, fix migration | 1 (manual review) |
| Merge conflict | Resolve conflict, re-test | 2 |
```

**Validation:**
```bash
grep -n "TASK-FAIL\|Recovery Protocol" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/tasks.md
```

### REF-006: Add Evidence Framework to Checklist (P0)

**Issue:** 233 checklist items with no citation/evidence mechanism

**File:** checklist.md  
**Location:** After line 15 (after Verification Protocol table)

**Action:** Add Evidence Requirements section and Evidence Log template

**Specific Changes:**

**After line 15, add:**
```markdown

### Evidence Requirements

Each checklist item verification MUST include evidence:

| Evidence Type | Format | Example |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| **Code** | `file.js:L###` | `rrf-fusion.js:L14` - k=60 constant |
| **Test** | `test-name PASS` | `rrf.test.js::fuse_results PASS` |
| **Metric** | `metric: value (target)` | `startup: 450ms (<500ms)` |
| **Manual** | `[VERIFIED] description` | `[VERIFIED] Cache invalidates on write` |
| **Screenshot** | `artifacts/img-###.png` | `artifacts/latency-chart-001.png` |

### Evidence Log Template

Add after each major verification section:

```markdown
#### Evidence Log - [Section Name]
| CHK-ID | Evidence Type | Location/Value | Verified By | Date |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------|
| CHK-010 | Code | session-manager.js:L45 | [Agent ID] | YYYY-MM-DD |
| CHK-013 | Metric | tokens: 180 (target: <200) | [Agent ID] | YYYY-MM-DD |
```
```

**Additionally, add Evidence Log sections after these major groups:**

**After Phase 1 Verification (line 82), add:**
```markdown

#### Evidence Log - Phase 1
| CHK-ID | Evidence Type | Location/Value | Verified By | Date |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------|
| | | | | |
```

**After Phase 2 Verification (line 120), add:**
```markdown

#### Evidence Log - Phase 2
| CHK-ID | Evidence Type | Location/Value | Verified By | Date |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------|
| | | | | |
```

**After Phase 3 Verification (line 200), add:**
```markdown

#### Evidence Log - Phase 3
| CHK-ID | Evidence Type | Location/Value | Verified By | Date |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------|
| | | | | |
```

**Validation:**
```bash
grep -n "Evidence Log" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/checklist.md | wc -l
# Expected: 4 (template + 3 phase sections)
```

---

### REF-007: Reclassify Aspirational P0 Items (P1)

**Issue:** Some P0 checklist items are aspirational metrics, not hard blockers

**File:** checklist.md  
**Items to reclassify:**
- CHK-013 [P0] → [P1]: "25-35% token savings measured on follow-up queries" (aspirational metric)
- CHK-017 [P0] → [P1]: "+20% tier differentiation accuracy validated" (aspirational metric)  
- CHK-126 [P0] → [P1]: "Search Quality: +40% relevance measured via user feedback" (aspirational, requires user study)

**Specific Changes:**

**Line 36:**
```markdown
- - [ ] CHK-013 [P0] 25-35% token savings measured on follow-up queries
+ - [ ] CHK-013 [P1] 25-35% token savings measured on follow-up queries (aspirational - exact percentage depends on usage patterns)
```

**Line 43:**
```markdown
- - [ ] CHK-017 [P0] +20% tier differentiation accuracy validated
+ - [ ] CHK-017 [P1] +20% tier differentiation accuracy validated (aspirational - requires baseline measurement)
```

**Line 423:**
```markdown
- - [ ] CHK-126 [P0] Search Quality: +40% relevance measured via user feedback
+ - [ ] CHK-126 [P1] Search Quality: +40% relevance measured via user feedback (aspirational - requires user study)
```

**Update Summary table at line 459-463:**
```markdown
| Category | Total | Verified |
|----------|-------|----------|
| P0 Items | 66 | [ ]/66 |
| P1 Items | 137 | [ ]/137 |
| P2 Items | 30 | [ ]/30 |
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Count P0 items before and after
grep -c "\[P0\]" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/checklist.md
# Before: 69, After: 66
```

### REF-008: Verify Audit Note in Tasks (P1)

**Issue:** Need to verify audit note about existing implementations was added

**File:** tasks.md  
**Status:** ✅ ALREADY PRESENT at lines 28-36

**Current Text (verified):**
```markdown
> **⚠️ AUDIT NOTE (2026-02-01):** A 20-agent parallel analysis found that several features already have partial implementations in the codebase:
> - **RRF Fusion** (T020-T023): `mcp_server/lib/search/rrf-fusion.js` exists with k=60, 10% convergence bonus
> - **Composite Scoring** (T032-T035): `mcp_server/lib/scoring/composite-scoring.js` exists with 6 factors
> - **FSRS Integration**: `mcp_server/lib/cognitive/fsrs-scheduler.js` exists
> - **5-State Model** (T056-T059): `mcp_server/lib/cognitive/tier-classifier.js` exists with HOT/WARM/COLD/DORMANT/ARCHIVED
>
> These tasks should be reviewed to determine scope: full rebuild, enhancement, or mark as [PARTIAL] complete.
> The **revised timeline** is estimated at ~6-7 weeks (not 11) since foundations exist.
```

**Validation:** ✅ No action needed - already present

---

### REF-009: Update implementation-summary.md Template Compliance (P1)

**Issue:** implementation-summary.md deviates from template - missing SPECKIT_LEVEL and SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE markers

**File:** implementation-summary.md  
**Location:** Line 1 (top of file)

**Specific Changes:**

**Add at line 1 (before existing content):**
```markdown
<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: impl-summary-core + level3plus-govern | v2.0 -->

```

**Note:** The rest of the file is acceptable as it documents a unique 20-agent analysis process. The format deviation is justified for this exploratory spec.

**Validation:**
```bash
head -3 specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/implementation-summary.md
```

---

### REF-010: Add Error Recovery Diagram (P1)

**Issue:** No error recovery flow diagram in plan.md

**File:** plan.md  
**Location:** After line 268 (after Data Reversal section in L2: ENHANCED ROLLBACK)

**Specific Changes:**

**Add new section:**
```markdown

### Error Recovery Flow

### REF-011: Document Skill Triggers (P1)

**Issue:** Skill triggers not documented for this spec

**File:** spec.md  
**Location:** After line 424 (before closing comment)

**Specific Changes:**

**Add new section:**
```markdown

## 18. SKILL TRIGGERS

This specification may invoke the following skills during implementation:

| Trigger Phrase | Skill | Usage |
|----------------|-------|-------|
| "implement session deduplication" | workflows-code | Phase 1 implementation |
| "add schema migration" | workflows-code | v4.1, v5 migrations |
| "create memory file" | system-spec-kit | Context preservation |
| "review code quality" | workflows-code | Pre-merge validation |
| "debug test failure" | workflows-code | Phase 2+ debugging |
| "document decision" | system-spec-kit | ADR creation |

**Note:** The `system-spec-kit` skill is primary for all spec folder operations. The `workflows-code` skill orchestrates actual implementation phases.

---
```

**Validation:**
```bash
grep -n "SKILL TRIGGERS\|Trigger Phrase" specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/082-speckit-reimagined/spec.md
```

---

### REF-012: Note Novel Patterns for Template Contribution (P2)

**Issue:** Novel patterns in this spec not documented for potential template contribution

**File:** implementation-summary.md  
**Location:** After line 118 (before Planned section)

**Specific Changes:**

**Add new section:**
```markdown

### Novel Patterns for Template Contribution

The following patterns developed in this spec may warrant addition to SpecKit templates:

| Pattern | Location | Potential Template Use |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| 20-agent parallel analysis | This spec | Large-scale research methodology |
| Competitor pattern comparison table | spec.md §17.1 | Comparative analysis template |
| Existing implementation audit | tasks.md audit note | Pre-implementation verification |
| Embedding-agnostic language | All files | Provider-neutral documentation |
| Phase-based evidence logs | checklist.md (planned) | Verification tracking |

**Recommendation:** After implementation completes, extract these patterns into `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/` as optional addendums.
```

**Validation:** Informational - no automated check needed

---

### REF-013: Address Extra File (feature-summary.md) (P2)

**Issue:** feature-summary.md is outside standard template structure

**Resolution:** This file is JUSTIFIED for Level 3+ specs with 33+ features. Document the justification.

**File:** feature-summary.md  
**Location:** Line 1

**Specific Changes:**

**Add after line 1 (after title):**
```markdown
<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: feature-summary (non-standard, justified for 33-feature scope) -->
<!-- JUSTIFICATION: Standard spec.md cannot adequately detail 33 features across 6 categories -->
```

**Validation:** Self-documenting - no automated check needed

---

### REF-014: Note Unpopulated Learning Metrics (P2)

**Issue:** Preflight/postflight learning metrics never populated

**Resolution:** This is acceptable - the spec is in Draft status and implementation hasn't started.

**File:** This refinement plan (documentation only)

**Action:** No file changes needed. Document expectation:

> **Note:** Learning metrics (task_preflight, task_postflight) should be populated when implementation begins. Current Draft status means no implementation has occurred, so empty metrics are expected.

**Validation:** Check after Phase 1 implementation begins

---

## Recommendation

Based on this analysis:

- [ ] APPROVE: 082 is ready for implementation after P0 fixes
- [x] **HOLD: P0 fixes required before proceeding**
- [ ] REJECT: Significant rework needed

**Rationale:** The spec folder documentation is substantially complete with good accuracy on existing implementations (already corrected). The 5 pending P0 fixes (REF-002 timeline, REF-003 critical path, REF-004 HALT conditions, REF-005 failure recovery, REF-006 evidence framework) are straightforward additions that ensure AI agents can execute safely. These should take ~1-2 hours to implement. After P0 fixes, the spec is ready for Phase 1 implementation.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Execute REF-002 through REF-006 (P0 fixes)
2. Run validation checklist
3. Begin Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
