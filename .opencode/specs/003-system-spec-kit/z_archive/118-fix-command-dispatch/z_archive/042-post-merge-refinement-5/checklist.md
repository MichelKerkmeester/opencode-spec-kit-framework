## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### AI Self-Verification Requirement

**This checklist is an ACTIVE VERIFICATION TOOL, not passive documentation.**

When this checklist exists (Level 2+), the AI MUST:

1. **Load** this checklist before claiming any completion
2. **Verify** each item systematically, starting with P0 items
3. **Mark** items `[x]` with evidence when verified
4. **Block** completion claims until all P0/P1 items are verified
5. **Document** any deferred P2 items with reasons

### Priority Enforcement

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0] Critical** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1] High** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval to defer |
| **[P2] Medium** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

### Evidence Format

When marking items complete, include evidence:

```markdown
- [x] CHK001 [P0] Duplicate function removed | Evidence: git diff shows removal at line 1111
- [x] CHK006 [P0] Column name fixed | Evidence: grep -r "last_accessed_at" returns 0 results
- [x] CHK024 [P0] Embeddings in checkpoints | Evidence: checkpoint file size increased from 50KB to 2MB
- [ ] CHK092 [P2] Fuzzy matching | Deferred: Post-MVP scope per user approval
```
