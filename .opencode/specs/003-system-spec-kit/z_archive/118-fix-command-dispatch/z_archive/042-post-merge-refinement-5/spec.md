## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Fix
- **Level**: 3
- **Tags**: spec-kit, memory-system, bug-fix, refinement
- **Priority**: P0
- **Feature Branch**: `042-post-merge-refinement-5`
- **Created**: 2025-12-25
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: 10-agent comprehensive analysis revealing 7 critical bugs, 8 significant issues, 10 refinements

### Stakeholders
- Engineering (primary implementer)
- AI Agent Users (end users of Spec Kit Memory system)

### Problem Statement
Following the major Spec Kit Memory merger, a comprehensive 10-agent analysis revealed systemic issues across the codebase:

- **7 critical bugs** causing runtime errors, data loss risk, or broken functionality
- **8 significant issues** causing confusion or degraded user experience  
- **10 refinement opportunities** for improved quality

The most severe issues include:
1. Duplicate function definitions breaking caching (`getConstitutionalMemories` defined twice)
2. Column name mismatches causing silent failures (`access_count` vs `accessCount`)
3. Missing database columns causing SQLite errors (`related_memories` column)
4. Empty trigger phrases breaking proactive memory surfacing
5. Embeddings lost during checkpoint restore operations

Overall system health assessed at **7/10** - functional but with significant reliability gaps.

### Purpose
Stabilize the Spec Kit Memory system by fixing all critical bugs, resolving significant issues, and implementing high-value refinements to achieve production-quality reliability.

### Assumptions

- Node.js runtime environment available (ES6+ support)
- better-sqlite3 library installed and functional
- sqlite-vec optional extension may or may not be present
- Existing memory database contains production data that must be preserved
- OpenCode environment with MCP server integration

**Assumptions Validation Checklist**:
- [x] All assumptions reviewed with stakeholders
- [x] Technical feasibility verified for each assumption
- [x] Risk assessment completed for critical assumptions
- [x] Fallback plans identified for uncertain assumptions

- Other skills (workflows-code, sk-git, sk-documentation) - unrelated
- Agent definitions in `.opencode/agent/` - unless directly related to Spec Kit
- New feature development beyond fixing identified issues
- Performance optimization beyond identified issues
- UI/UX redesign of commands

## 3. USERS & STORIES

### User Story 1 - Fix Critical Runtime Bugs (Priority: P0)

As a developer using the Spec Kit Memory system, I need the system to operate without runtime errors so that my workflow is not interrupted by crashes or silent failures.

**Why This Priority**: P0 because runtime errors and data loss risks make the system unreliable for production use. The duplicate function definitions and column mismatches cause immediate failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the MCP server and verifying no startup errors, then executing memory operations (save, search, checkpoint) and verifying no SQLite errors or data corruption.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** MCP server starts, **When** constitutional cache initializes, **Then** no duplicate function errors occur
2. **Given** memory is accessed, **When** access tracking updates, **Then** correct column (`access_count`) is updated
3. **Given** memory has related memories, **When** saving to database, **Then** `related_memories` column exists and stores data
4. **Given** checkpoint is restored, **When** memories are loaded, **Then** embeddings are preserved (not null/empty)
5. **Given** memory file is generated, **When** trigger phrases are extracted, **Then** non-empty array is produced

---

### User Story 2 - Resolve Documentation Inconsistencies (Priority: P1)

As a developer reading Spec Kit documentation, I need consistent gate numbering and terminology across AGENTS.md, SKILL.md, and commands so that I can follow the correct workflow without confusion.

**Why This Priority**: P1 because inconsistent documentation causes user confusion and incorrect behavior, but doesn't cause runtime failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by auditing all documentation files for gate numbering (1-4 vs 1-5), command references, and terminology consistency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** user reads AGENTS.md, **When** they check gate numbering, **Then** it matches SKILL.md exactly
2. **Given** user reads command help, **When** they see referenced tools, **Then** all tools exist and are documented
3. **Given** user follows workflow, **When** they use spec_kit commands, **Then** behavior matches documentation

---

### User Story 3 - Implement Quality Refinements (Priority: P2)

As a developer using the memory system, I need improved search quality and better error handling so that the system is more reliable and helpful.

**Why This Priority**: P2 because these are quality-of-life improvements that enhance experience but system is functional without them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by exercising search functionality with `includeContiguity` flag, verifying timeout handling, and checking error messages for clarity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** hybrid search with `includeContiguity: true`, **When** search executes, **Then** contiguous memories are included
2. **Given** search operation, **When** timeout occurs, **Then** graceful error message is returned
3. **Given** any operation fails, **When** error is returned, **Then** message clearly indicates cause and resolution

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & RISKS

### Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Owner | Status | Impact if Blocked |
|------------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| better-sqlite3 | Technical | npm | Green | Cannot run database operations |
| sqlite-vec | Technical | npm (optional) | Yellow | Fall back to keyword search |
| Node.js 18+ | Technical | System | Green | Cannot run MCP server |
| OpenCode runtime | Technical | OpenCode | Green | Cannot test integration |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Description | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|-------------|--------|------------|---------------------|-------|
| R-001 | Database migration breaks existing data | High | Medium | Backup before migration, test on copy first | Engineering |
| R-002 | Documentation changes cause confusion | Medium | Low | Announce changes, provide migration notes | Engineering |
| R-003 | Fixes introduce new bugs | Medium | Medium | Comprehensive testing, staged rollout | Engineering |
| R-004 | sqlite-vec dependency issues | Low | Low | Graceful fallback already implemented | Engineering |

### Rollback Plan

- **Rollback Trigger**: Runtime errors increase after deployment OR data corruption detected
- **Rollback Procedure**:
  1. Stop MCP server
  2. Restore database from backup (created before migration)
  3. Revert code changes via git
  4. Restart MCP server
  5. Verify functionality restored
- **Data Migration Reversal**: Database backup created before any schema changes; restore backup if needed

---

## 9. OUT OF SCOPE

**Explicit Exclusions**:

- **LEANN MCP changes** - Separate semantic search system with independent codebase
- **Narsil MCP changes** - Code analysis system not related to Spec Kit
- **Other skills modifications** - workflows-code, sk-git, sk-documentation have separate concerns
- **New feature development** - Focus is on fixing existing issues, not adding capabilities
- **Performance optimization** - Beyond fixing identified performance bugs
- **UI/UX redesign** - Commands will work the same way, just correctly

---

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS

- **Resolved**: Gate numbering will standardize on Gates 1-4 (confirmed from AGENTS.md analysis)
- **Resolved**: Memory file format will follow ANCHOR structure (confirmed from template analysis)
- All major questions resolved during 10-agent analysis phase

## 12. WORKING FILES

### File Organization During Development

**Temporary/exploratory files MUST be placed in:**
- `scratch/` - For drafts, prototypes, debug logs, test queries (git-ignored)

**Permanent documentation belongs in:**
- Root of spec folder - spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md, decision-record.md
- `memory/` - Session context and conversation history

**Anti-pattern - DO NOT:**
- Place temporary files (debug-*.md, test-*.js, scratch-*.json) in project root
- Place disposable content in spec folder root (use scratch/ instead)

### Decision Flow
```
Is this content disposable after the task?
  YES -> scratch/
  NO  -> Will future sessions need this context?
          YES -> memory/
          NO  -> spec folder (permanent docs)
```
