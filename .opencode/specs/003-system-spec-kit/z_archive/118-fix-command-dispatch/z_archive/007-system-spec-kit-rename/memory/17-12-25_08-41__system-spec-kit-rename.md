## 2. OVERVIEW

The workflows-spec-kit skill was successfully renamed to system-spec-kit across the entire codebase. This involved a comprehensive 5-phase approach: (1) Directory rename from .opencode/skills/workflows-spec-kit/ to .opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/, (2) 81 internal skill references updated using 6 parallel agents, (3) 109 external references updated using 8 parallel agents, (4) Verification with 8 agents plus remediation of 7 additional references found, (5) Documentation completed and checklist verified. Total of 197 replacements across approximately 41 files.

**Key Outcomes**:
- The workflows-spec-kit skill was successfully renamed to system-spec-kit across the entire...
- Preserved historical documentation in specs/ directories unchanged - these serve
- Kept /spec_kit:* command names unchanged - command namespace is separate from sk
- Kept 'SpecKit' brand name in prose unchanged - brand names in documentation don'
- Used 25 parallel sub-agents for efficient execution - task complexity warranted

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 008-system-spec-kit-rename` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "008-system-spec-kit-rename" })` |

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above
