=== Complexity Detector Tests ===

Basic Detection:
  ✓ detect returns object with required fields
  ✓ detect simple task returns Level 1
  ✓ detect complex auth task detects risk
  ✓ detect multi-agent task detects coordination

Input Validation:
  ✓ detect throws for non-string input
  ✓ detect handles empty string gracefully
  ✓ detect handles whitespace-only string

Score Ranges:
  ✓ totalScore is between 0 and 100
  ✓ confidence is between 50 and 95

Level Mapping:
  ✓ score 0-25 maps to Level 1

Breakdown Structure:
  ✓ breakdown has all 5 dimensions
  ✓ each dimension has score, weight, and triggers

Quick Detect:
  ✓ quickDetect returns simplified result

Format Result:
  ✓ formatResult returns string

Dimension Detection:
  ✓ detects scope signals from LOC mentions
  ✓ detects risk signals from security keywords
  ✓ detects research signals from investigation keywords
  ✓ detects coordination signals from dependency keywords

Weight Verification:
  ✓ weights sum to 100
  ✓ scope weight is 25
  ✓ risk weight is 25
  ✓ research weight is 20
  ✓ multiAgent weight is 15
  ✓ coordination weight is 15
  ✓ weightedScore calculation is correct

Level Mapping (Explicit):
  ✓ score 26-55 maps to Level 2
  ✓ score 56-79 maps to Level 3
  ✓ score 80+ maps to Level 3+

Edge Cases:
