# Session Handover: Dynamic Complexity-Based Template Scaling

**Spec Folder**: `specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity`
**Attempt**: 2
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Status**: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - TEST COVERAGE EXPANDED

---

## Session Summary

This session significantly expanded the test coverage for the Dynamic Complexity-Based Template Scaling system, growing from 94 tests to 171 tests (82% increase) with 100% coverage achieved. All identified testing gaps have been addressed.

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Test Coverage Achievement (94 to 171 tests)**
   - Created `test-classifier.js` with 49 new tests for level boundaries, features, and gates
   - Enhanced `test-detector.js` with 10 new weight verification and level mapping tests
   - Enhanced `test-marker-parser.js` with 16 new exactLevel and shouldAutoEnableFeature tests
   - Enhanced `test-cli.sh` with 2 new file input happy-path tests
   - Created `fixtures/sample-request.txt` test fixture
   - Updated `run-tests.sh` to include new test suite
   - **Result: 100% test coverage, all 171 tests passing**

2. **Documentation Created**
   - `test-summary.md` - Comprehensive test coverage documentation (171 tests, all gaps addressed)
   - `output-examples.md` - Complete examples of complexity detection at all 4 levels

3. **Coverage Gaps Addressed**
   - Level boundary thresholds (0/25/26/55/56/79/80/100)
   - Weight verification (25+25+20+15+15=100)
   - shouldAutoEnableFeature for all 8 features
   - exactLevel condition parsing and evaluation
   - CLI happy-path with real file fixtures
   - Feature availability at each level
   - Feature requirements at each level
   - Gate expression building and parsing
   - Suggest adjustment logic

## Key Decisions/Context

### Technical Details (From Original Implementation)

- **5-Dimension Scoring**: Scope 25%, Risk 25%, Research 20%, Multi-Agent 15%, Coordination 15%
- **Level Thresholds**: 0-25 to L1, 26-55 to L2, 56-79 to L3, 80-100 to L3+
- **COMPLEXITY_GATE markers**: HTML comments for conditional template content
- **8 auto-enable features**: ai-protocol, dependency-graph, effort-estimation, extended-checklist, executive-summary, workstreams, milestones, research-methodology

### Critical Boundary Tests Added

| Score | Expected Level | Test Status |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 0 | Level 1 | Verified |
| 25 | Level 1 (upper) | Verified |
| 26 | Level 2 (lower) | Verified |
| 55 | Level 2 (upper) | Verified |
| 56 | Level 3 (lower) | Verified |
| 79 | Level 3 (upper) | Verified |
| 80 | Level 3+ (lower) | Verified |
| 100 | Level 3+ | Verified |

## Potential Next Steps (Future Work)

The following items were identified as future improvements but are NOT part of the current implementation:

1. **Integration with SKILL.md** - Update Gate 3 flow to use complexity detection
2. **Template markers** - Add COMPLEXITY_GATE markers to actual templates (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md)
3. **Validation rules** - Implement check-complexity.sh, check-section-counts.sh rules
4. **User testing** - Test complexity detection with real spec folder creation
5. **Retrospective validation** - Validate detection accuracy against historical specs 056-068
