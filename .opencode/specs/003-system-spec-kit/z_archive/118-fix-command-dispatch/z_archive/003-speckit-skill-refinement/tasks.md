## Final Metrics

| File | Before | After | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| SKILL.md | 783 | 229 | **-71%** |
| level_specifications.md | 422 | 263 | -38% |
| template_guide.md | 837 | 223 | **-73%** |
| automation_workflows.md | 579 | 237 | -59% |
| quick_reference.md | 574 | 183 | **-68%** |
| path_scoped_rules.md | 435 | 105 | **-76%** |
| level_decision_matrix.md | 175 | 68 | -61% |
| template_mapping.md | 257 | 74 | **-71%** |
| **TOTAL** | **4,062** | **1,382** | **-66%** |

## Key Improvements

1. **Single source of truth**: Progressive enhancement model defined once in `level_specifications.md`
2. **Clear cross-references**: Each file links to canonical sources
3. **Tables over prose**: Converted repetitive explanations to scannable tables
4. **Status clarity**: `path_scoped_rules.md` now clearly marked as NOT IMPLEMENTED
5. **Streamlined SKILL.md**: Orchestrator role with links to deep-dive references
