# Implementation Summary: Spec Kit Bug Remediation

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3+ -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: implementation-summary | v2.0 -->

---

## Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | `specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/080-speckit-bug-remediation` |
| **Implementation Date** | 2026-01-28 |
| **Duration** | Single session (10 parallel Opus agents) |
| **LOC Changed** | ~800 lines across 18 files |
| **Status** | COMPLETE - All 30 bugs fixed and verified |

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully remediated 30 bugs identified by comprehensive 10-agent audit of the Spec Kit MCP server. Bugs ranged from critical (FSRS integration broken, ReDoS vulnerabilities) to low priority (input validation, error sanitization). All fixes verified with test suite (52/52 FSRS tests, 75/78 modularization tests).

**Key Outcomes**:
- 3 CRITICAL bugs fixed (FSRS now executes, thresholds differentiated)
- 8 HIGH bugs fixed (ReDoS eliminated, cache methods added, data loss prevented)
- 9 MEDIUM bugs fixed (transactions atomic, tier weights consolidated)
- 10 LOW bugs fixed (input validation, error handling improved)
- Zero regressions introduced

## Verification Results

### Test Suite

```
FSRS Scheduler Tests:    52/52 PASS
Modularization Tests:    75/78 PASS (3 pre-existing line-count warnings)
Server Start:            SUCCESS
```

### ReDoS Verification

| Test | Input | Time | Status |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| YAML parsing | 100 malformed entries | 3ms | PASS |
| Trigger extraction | Adversarial strings | <10ms | PASS |

### Transaction Safety

- Checkpoint restore: SAVEPOINT rollback verified
- Bulk delete: Atomic all-or-nothing verified
- Schema migration: Transaction wrapper verified

## Architecture Decisions

| ADR | Decision | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| ADR-001 | Phased parallel execution | Risk isolation + efficiency |
| ADR-002 | Line-by-line YAML parsing | Eliminates ReDoS entirely |
| ADR-003 | Tier weight consolidation | Single source of truth |
| ADR-004 | SAVEPOINT for restore | Atomic at database level |
| ADR-005 | Add LRUCache methods | Minimal change surface |
| ADR-006 | Fix FSRS signature | Enable cognitive upgrade |
| ADR-007 | Differentiate thresholds | Meaningful behavior zones |

---

## Implementation Team

| Phase | Agents | Bugs | Status |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| Audit | 10 | Discovery | COMPLETE |
| Phase 1 | 5 | 001-015 | COMPLETE |
| Phase 2-3 | 5 | 016-030 | COMPLETE |

All agents completed successfully with parallel execution.

---

## Performance Impact

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ReDoS worst case | Hang (infinite) | <10ms |
| Cache stampede | N concurrent DB queries | 1 query |
| FSRS execution | Never (fallback only) | Always |

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues discovered post-deployment:
1. Git revert specific bug fix commits
2. Run test suite to verify rollback
3. Investigate root cause with agent
