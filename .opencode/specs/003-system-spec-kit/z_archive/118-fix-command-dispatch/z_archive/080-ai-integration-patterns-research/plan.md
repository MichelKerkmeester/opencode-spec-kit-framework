# Research Plan: AI Integration Patterns

## Objective

Extract actionable patterns from three AI-focused repositories to improve system-spec-kit MCP.

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis (Completed)
- [x] Fetch repository structures
- [x] Identify key implementation files
- [x] Extract source code for analysis

### Phase 2: Pattern Extraction (Completed)
- [x] Context optimization patterns
- [x] Prompt engineering patterns
- [x] Tool integration patterns
- [x] Response processing patterns
- [x] Session management patterns

### Phase 3: Synthesis (Completed)
- [x] Compare patterns across repositories
- [x] Map to spec-kit current implementation
- [x] Prioritize recommendations

### Phase 4: Documentation (Completed)
- [x] Create research.md with 13 sections
- [x] Include code examples
- [x] Document anti-patterns
- [x] Cite evidence sources

## Key Findings

1. **Hierarchical Compression** - drift uses 3 compression levels (summary/expanded/full) for token efficiency
2. **Intent-Aware Retrieval** - drift adjusts memory weights based on development intent (add_feature, fix_bug, etc.)
3. **Multi-Factor Decay** - drift combines temporal decay, usage boost, importance anchor, and pattern boost
4. **Zod Schema Tools** - seu-claude uses Zod for runtime validation and auto-generated JSON Schema
5. **Lazy Singleton** - dotmd loads ML models once on first request
6. **Task DAG** - seu-claude persists hierarchical tasks with tool output caching
7. **RRF Fusion** - dotmd merges multi-engine results without requiring normalized scores

## Recommendations Summary

| Priority | Recommendation | Source |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| High | Add hierarchical compression | drift |
| High | Implement token budget management | drift |
| Medium | Add intent parameter | drift |
| Medium | Add usage boost to decay | drift |
| Low | Consider RRF fusion | dotmd |
