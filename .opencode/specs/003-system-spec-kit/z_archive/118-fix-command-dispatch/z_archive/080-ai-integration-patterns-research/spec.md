# AI Integration Patterns Research

## Overview

Cross-repository analysis of AI assistant integration patterns from three open-source projects to inform improvements to the system-spec-kit MCP.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Context window optimization patterns
- Prompt engineering approaches
- Tool integration patterns (MCP)
- Response processing methods
- Session management techniques

### Out of Scope
- Implementation of recommendations
- Performance benchmarking
- Security analysis of external code

## Repositories Analyzed

1. **dotmd** - Markdown knowledgebase with hybrid search (semantic + BM25 + graph)
2. **seu-claude** - Hexagonal codebase RAG MCP server with task DAG
3. **drift** - Codebase pattern detection with Cortex memory system

## Key Deliverables

1. Pattern catalog with code examples
2. Best practices for each category
3. Anti-patterns to avoid
4. Specific recommendations for system-spec-kit MCP improvements

## Success Criteria

- [x] All three repositories analyzed
- [x] Patterns documented with evidence citations
- [x] Recommendations prioritized by effort/impact
- [x] Code examples provided for key patterns
- [x] Anti-patterns identified

## Documentation Level

**Level 1** - Research-only task, no implementation
