# Spec 071 Test Files Scan

Scan completed: 2026-01-16

## Summary

**No dedicated test files found for Spec 071 (Level Alignment).**

Spec 071 implementation relied on existing test suites from Spec 069 (Template Complexity System) for verification. According to the implementation summary, 171/171 existing tests continued to pass after the alignment changes.

## Verification Strategy Used by Spec 071

According to `implementation-summary.md`, Spec 071 used the following verification approach:

### Test Types

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Unit Tests | Passed | 171/171 existing tests continue to pass |
| Integration | Passed | `create-spec-folder.sh` tested at levels 1, 2, 3 |
| Manual | Passed | Verified template file sizes match expected level content |

### Verification Commands Run

```bash
# Verified level folders exist and contain correct files
ls -la .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/level_*/

# Verified no COMPLEXITY_GATE markers in level folders
grep -r "COMPLEXITY_GATE" .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/level_*/
# Result: No matches

# Verified no broken paths in scripts
grep -r "templates/spec.md" .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/
# Result: No matches

# Ran full test suite
bash specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/run-tests.sh
# Result: 171 passed, 0 failed
```

## Recommendations

1. **No new tests needed for Spec 071 specifically** - The implementation was architectural alignment rather than new functionality
2. **Existing test coverage is adequate** - Spec 069's 171 tests cover template processing logic
3. **Integration tests already validate level selection** - The test-cli.sh tests verify correct level folder selection
4. **Manual verification was appropriate** - File structure changes were verified through grep and ls commands

## Files Modified by Spec 071

The following files were modified but rely on existing test coverage:

| File | Test Coverage |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `scripts/create-spec-folder.sh` | test-cli.sh (integration), manual verification |
| `scripts/expand-template.js` | test-cli.sh, test-preprocessor.js |
| `lib/expansion/preprocessor.js` | test-preprocessor.js |
| `lib/complexity/features.js` | test-classifier.js, test-detector.js |
| `lib/expansion/marker-parser.js` | test-marker-parser.js (deprecated but tested) |
| Documentation files (SKILL.md, README.md, etc.) | Manual review |
