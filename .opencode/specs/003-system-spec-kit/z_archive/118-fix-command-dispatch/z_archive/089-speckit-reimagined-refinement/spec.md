# Spec 089: system-spec-kit Reimagined Refinement

> Comprehensive audit and remediation plan for the entire system-spec-kit skill ecosystem, covering SKILL.md, references, assets, scripts, config, MCP server, agents, and commands.

---

## 1. SCOPE

### In Scope

- **SKILL.md**: Fix 15 identified documentation errors (LOC estimates, naming, cross-references)
- **References directory** (22 files): Fix 13 broken cross-references, 3 data inconsistencies
- **Assets directory** (4 files): Fix 5 critical bugs (broken refs, missing Level 3+ coverage)
- **Scripts directory** (~50 files): Address 12 issues including security (eval in validate.sh), logic bugs
- **Config directory** (4 files): Fix 2 CRITICAL bugs (filters.jsonc path + naming mismatch), remove dead config
- **MCP Server**: Fix MEDIUM-HIGH LIKE injection, indentation bug, duplicate security boundaries
- **Agents directory** (7 files): Fix mode/permission frontmatter errors, missing sections, model staleness
- **Pre-analysis 081**: Archive as superseded (all recommendations already implemented)

### Out of Scope

- Commands directory (audit found 0 issues - fully compliant)
- New feature development (RRF, BM25, cross-encoder, etc. already implemented per 081 findings)
- MCP server architecture changes (architecture scored 8/10)
- Template content changes (only cross-reference fixes)

### Dependencies

- Public repo symlink: `.opencode/` -> `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode`
- All edits affect the Public repo (framework-level changes)
