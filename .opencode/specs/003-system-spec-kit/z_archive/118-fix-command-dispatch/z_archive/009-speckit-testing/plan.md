## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Plan
- **Tags**: speckit, testing
- **Priority**: P1
- **Branch**: `005-speckit-testing`
- **Date**: 2025-12-17
- **Spec**: spec.md

### Summary
Execute comprehensive testing of all SpecKit features using 5 parallel agents to verify the rename from workflows-spec-kit to system-spec-kit was successful.

---

## 2. TEST STRATEGY

### Parallel Agent Deployment

| Agent | Domain | Tools | Success Criteria |
|-------|--------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Script Testing | Bash | All 6 scripts execute without errors |
| 2 | Template Validation | Read, Glob | All 9 templates valid with proper markers |
| 3 | Reference Documentation | Read, Grep | References match AGENTS.md |
| 4 | Path Verification | Grep | Zero orphaned old references |
| 5 | E2E Integration | Bash | Workflow creates valid spec folders |

### Dependencies
- All agents can run in parallel (no inter-dependencies)
- Agent outputs will be synthesized by orchestrator

---

## 3. EXECUTION PHASES

### Phase 1: Agent Dispatch
Launch all 5 agents simultaneously with explicit scope and success criteria.

### Phase 2: Output Evaluation
Evaluate each agent output against:
- Accuracy: Results match expected behavior
- Completeness: All items in scope were tested
- Consistency: No conflicting findings

### Phase 3: Synthesis
Combine agent outputs into unified test report.

## 4. SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Script pass rate | 100% |
| Template validation | 100% |
| Reference consistency | 100% |
| Orphaned paths found | 0 |
| E2E workflow success | Yes |
