# Feature Specification: SpecKit System Architecture Analysis

> Deep architectural analysis of the SpecKit system, covering the interaction between AGENTS.md, Skills, Commands, and Data.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec | v1.0 -->

## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata
- **Category**: Analysis
- **Tags**: speckit, architecture, audit, system-design
- **Priority**: P1
- **Feature Branch**: `004-speckit/008-system-analysis`
- **Created**: 2025-12-22
- **Status**: Complete
- **Input**: User request for deep analysis using Sequential Thinking

### Stakeholders
- System Architects
- AI Agents
- Project Maintainers

### Purpose
To deconstruct and analyze the SpecKit system's architecture, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and structural risks (specifically the synchronization between Skills and Commands).

### Deliverables
- **Analysis Report**: `analysis-report.md` (Detailed architectural audit)

---

## 2. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Analysis of `AGENTS.md` (Constitution)
- Analysis of `system-spec-kit` Skill (Engine)
- Analysis of `.opencode/command` YAMLs (Orchestrator)
- Analysis of `specs/` folder structure (Memory)
- Identification of "Drift" risks

### Out of Scope
- Implementation of recommended fixes (Level 0, Build Scripts)
- Modification of existing YAML workflows

---

## 3. KEY FINDINGS

> See `analysis-report.md` for full details.

### 1. The Fractal Bureaucracy
The system uses agents to audit itself, creating a self-reinforcing quality loop.

### 2. The Parity Gap
A critical risk exists where `SKILL.md` (Documentation) and `*.yaml` (Execution) drift apart due to manual synchronization.

### 3. Context Isolation
The `memory/` folder strategy effectively prevents context pollution but requires strict discipline.

## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

1.  **Unify Source of Truth**: Generate Documentation from Code (YAML).
2.  **Level 0 Protocol**: Reduce friction for trivial changes.
3.  **Visual Orchestration**: Auto-generate Mermaid diagrams from YAMLs.
