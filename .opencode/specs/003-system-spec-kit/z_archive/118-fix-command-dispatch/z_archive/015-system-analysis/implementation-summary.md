# Implementation Summary: SpecKit Command Pattern Reference Upgrade

> Summary of changes to `system-spec-kit` skill to implement Pattern Extraction Protocol.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: implementation-summary | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. Feature Branch
`specs/004-speckit/008-system-analysis`

## 2. Files Modified/Created
- **Modified**: `.opencode/skills/system-spec-kit/SKILL.md`
    - Added "COMMAND PATTERN REFERENCE PROTOCOL" (Section 5).
    - Removed "REFERENCES" (Old Section 4).
    - Renumbered sections for clean flow.
- **Created**: `specs/004-speckit/008-system-analysis/plan.md` (Revised Plan)

## 3. Verification Steps
- [x] Verified insertion of "COMMAND PATTERN REFERENCE PROTOCOL".
- [x] Verified deletion of redundant "REFERENCES" section.
- [x] Verified renumbering (1-8).
- [x] Verified internal link update ("See Section 6 (RULES)").

## 4. Deviations from Plan
- **Refinement**: Moved "Command Pattern" protocol from Section 3 to Section 5 based on user feedback to prioritize "Folder Choice Enforcement".
- **Refinement**: Deleted "References" section as the Router (Section 2) handles resource loading logic.

## 5. Skill Updates
- **system-spec-kit**: Now includes a mandatory protocol for manual agents to reference Command patterns, positioned logically after "How It Works".

## 6. Next Steps
- **Team Awareness**: Inform other agents (via memory/context) that they should now scan for commands.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for agents citing "spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml" in their summaries.

---

## 7. Command Pattern Reference Report
*As per the new protocol (recursive application!)*

- **Referenced Command**: `spec_kit_complete_auto.yaml`
- **Adaptation**:
    - Extracted the **Step 11 Completion** logic.
    - Applied it here by creating this `implementation-summary.md`.
    - Extracted the **Confidence Checkpoint** logic (Self-Correction during renumbering).
