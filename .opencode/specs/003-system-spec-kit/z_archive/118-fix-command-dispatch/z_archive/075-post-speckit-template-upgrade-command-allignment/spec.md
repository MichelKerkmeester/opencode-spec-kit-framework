# Spec 076: Post-SpecKit Template Upgrade - Command Alignment

## Overview

Comprehensive analysis of specs 072-075 in 003-memory-and-spec-kit combined with current system-spec-kit state to determine command alignment needs.

## Scope

### In Scope
- Analysis of specs 072-075 (template, memory ranking, optimization, testing)
- Current system-spec-kit skill state assessment
- Command alignment gap identification
- Command updates/improvements based on recent SpecKit changes
- Documentation alignment with write.md and command_template.md

### Out of Scope
- New feature development
- Breaking changes to existing command interfaces
- Changes to other skills outside system-spec-kit

## Success Criteria

1. All commands aligned with current system-spec-kit capabilities
2. Command templates comply with command_template.md standards
3. Documentation follows write.md workflow requirements
4. No orphaned or deprecated functionality
