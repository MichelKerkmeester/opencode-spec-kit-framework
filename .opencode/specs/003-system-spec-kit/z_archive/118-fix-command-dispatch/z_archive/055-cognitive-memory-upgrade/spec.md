# Spec: Cognitive Memory Upgrade Research

## Overview
Research upgrading Spec Kit Memory system with ideas and principles from the claude-cognitive repository, adapted for OpenCode's hook-less architecture.

## Scope
- **In Scope:** Analysis of claude-cognitive concepts, feasibility assessment, recommendations
- **Out of Scope:** Implementation (research only)

## Constraints
- OpenCode does not have hooks - all hook-dependent features need alternative approaches
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing memory system
- Analysis and recommendations only - no code changes

## Success Criteria
- Comprehensive analysis of claude-cognitive architecture
- Clear mapping of transferable vs non-transferable concepts
- Actionable recommendations with implementation paths
