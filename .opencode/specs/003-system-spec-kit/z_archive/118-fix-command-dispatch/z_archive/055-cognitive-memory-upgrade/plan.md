# Plan: Cognitive Memory Upgrade Research

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Current State Analysis
- [ ] Document current Spec Kit Memory architecture
- [ ] Review MCP server implementation
- [ ] Understand database schema and indexing

### Phase 2: External Research
- [ ] Fetch and analyze claude-cognitive repository
- [ ] Identify core concepts and architecture
- [ ] Map hook-dependent vs hook-independent features

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis
- [ ] Compare current system to claude-cognitive
- [ ] Identify enhancement opportunities
- [ ] Assess feasibility without hooks

### Phase 4: Recommendations
- [ ] Prioritize improvements by impact/effort
- [ ] Propose alternative implementations for hook-dependent features
- [ ] Create actionable roadmap
