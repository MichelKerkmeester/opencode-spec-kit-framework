# Verification Checklist: SpecKit Refinement Phase 1 MVP

Comprehensive verification checklist for the Handover System MVP implementation.

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. OBJECTIVE

### Metadata

## 9. VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

### Priority Enforcement

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0] Critical** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until ALL pass |

| **[P2] Polish** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

### Evidence Format

When marking items complete, include evidence:

```markdown
- [x] CHK001 [P0] Template exists | Evidence: `ls -la .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/templates/quick-continue.md`
- [x] CHK010 [P0] Valid YAML frontmatter | Evidence: Verified description, argument-hint, allowed-tools present
