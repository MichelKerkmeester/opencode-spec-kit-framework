## What Was Built

Added nested spec folder path support to `generate-context.ts` and `folder-detector.ts`. The scripts now resolve parent/child folder paths (e.g., `003-parent/121-child`), bare child names with auto-search, and all prefix variants (`specs/`, `.opencode/specs/`). All 7 test cases pass with a clean build. Total: ~335 LOC across 5 files.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | LOC | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----|---------|
| `generate-context.ts` | Modified | ~151 | Modified `isValidSpecFolder()`, `parseArguments()`, `validateArguments()` + new `findChildFolder()` + help text |
| `folder-detector.ts` | Modified | ~116 | Modified Priority 1 (CLI), Priority 2 (JSON), Priority 4 (Auto) + critical `path.isAbsolute()` fix at line 74 |
| `SKILL.md` | Modified | ~25 | Added "Subfolder Support" section to Context Preservation |
| `sub_folder_versioning.md` | Modified | ~35 | Added Section 8 "generate-context.js Integration" |
| `AGENTS.md` | Modified | ~8 | Added subfolder examples to MEMORY SAVE RULE |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Root cause fix at `folder-detector.ts:74` — add `path.isAbsolute(specArg)` as first check in ternary chain | When `parseArguments()` resolved a nested path to an absolute path, `detectSpecFolder()` would prepend ANOTHER base directory, creating a nonsensical double-path. The 1-line fix prevents this by checking absolute paths first. |
| Bare child auto-resolution via separate code path | Takes a completely different path than `detectSpecFolder()`, avoiding the double-path bug entirely. Worked on first try. |
| Defer P1 code duplication cleanup | Bare child search is implemented 3 times (sync in generate-context, async 2x in folder-detector). Valid concern but consolidation is a separate scope item. |

## Verification

| Test | Input Format | Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `003-parent/121-child` (nested) | Pass | Core nested path resolution |
| 2 | `specs/003-parent/121-child` (prefix) | Pass | Strips `specs/` prefix |
| 3 | `.opencode/specs/003-parent/121-child` (prefix) | Pass | Strips `.opencode/specs/` prefix |
| 4 | `121-child` (bare child auto-resolve) | Pass | Auto-searches all parents for unique match |
| 5 | `003-parent` (flat, backward compat) | Pass | Existing flat-folder input unchanged |
| 6 | Absolute path | Pass | Direct absolute path passthrough |
| 7 | `--help` | Pass | Help text displays correctly |

**Code Review:** 91/100 EXCELLENT. 0 P0 blockers, 1 P1 (code duplication — deferred), 6 P2 suggestions.

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- **~~Code duplication (P1):~~** Resolved in Phase 2b — consolidated into `scripts/core/subfolder-utils.ts`.
- **Backward compatibility:** Fully preserved. All existing flat-folder inputs continue working. New code is additive (new branches in existing functions) with no restructuring.

## Phase 2b: P1 Code Duplication Fix + Tests

### What Was Done

Resolved the P1 code duplication issue identified in the initial code review (3 independent bare-child-search implementations → 1 shared utility), created a comprehensive test suite, and updated external AGENTS.md files.

### Files Created

| File | Action | LOC | Purpose |
|------|--------|-----|---------|
| `scripts/core/subfolder-utils.ts` | Created | ~135 | Shared utility: `findChildFolderSync`, `findChildFolderAsync`, `SPEC_FOLDER_PATTERN`, `SPEC_FOLDER_BASIC_PATTERN` |
| `scripts/tests/test-subfolder-resolution.js` | Created | ~410 | 21 tests covering all exported functions and patterns |

### Files Modified

| File | Action | LOC Change | Purpose |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| `generate-context.ts` | Refactored | -46 LOC | Removed local patterns + `findChildFolder()` function, now imports from `subfolder-utils` |
| `folder-detector.ts` | Refactored | -59 LOC | Removed 2 inline bare-child-search implementations + local pattern, now uses `findChildFolderAsync` |
| `core/index.ts` | Modified | +1 LOC | Added re-export from `subfolder-utils` |
| `anobel.com/AGENTS.md` | Modified | ~15 LOC | Added subfolder support content to memory save rule (after line 225) |
| `Barter/coder/AGENTS.md` | Modified | ~15 LOC | Added subfolder support content to memory save rule (after line 236) |

### Quality Improvement

**Before:** Bare child folder search was duplicated in 3 places:
1. `generate-context.ts` — synchronous `findChildFolder()` + local `SPEC_FOLDER_PATTERN`
2. `folder-detector.ts` Priority 1 — inline async bare-child search + local pattern
3. `folder-detector.ts` Priority 4 — second inline async bare-child search

**After:** Single source of truth in `scripts/core/subfolder-utils.ts`:
- `findChildFolderSync()` — used by `generate-context.ts`
- `findChildFolderAsync()` — used by `folder-detector.ts` (both Priority 1 and 4)
- `SPEC_FOLDER_PATTERN` and `SPEC_FOLDER_BASIC_PATTERN` — shared regex constants
- Re-exported via `core/index.ts` for external consumers

Net LOC reduction: ~105 lines removed, ~135 lines added (shared module) = ~30 LOC net addition, but 3 implementations → 1 with full test coverage.

### Test Results

| Suite | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Subfolder resolution tests | 21/21 | All pass |
| Folder-detector functional tests | 27/27 | All pass |
| `tsc --build` | — | 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| `--help` smoke test | — | Pass |

## Lessons Learned

1. The real bug was a 1-line oversight in `folder-detector.ts` (not in the new code) — `path.isAbsolute()` should have been the first check from the start.
2. Bare child auto-resolution worked on first try because it takes a completely different code path (doesn't go through `detectSpecFolder`).
3. Having a comprehensive test matrix (7 formats) caught the resolution bug immediately.
4. The code duplication P1 was resolved in Phase 2b — consolidation into `subfolder-utils.ts` removed ~105 LOC of duplication and enabled a shared test suite (21 tests).
