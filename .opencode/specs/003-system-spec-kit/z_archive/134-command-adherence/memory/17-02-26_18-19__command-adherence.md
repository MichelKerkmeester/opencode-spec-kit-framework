title: "To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced) [134-command-adherence/17-02-26_18-19__command-adherence]"
importance_tier: "normal"
contextType: "general"

<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Three compounding factors: (1) Gate 3 had no phase boundary — once answered during planning it was permanently satisfied, (2) Memory Save Rule 'do NOT re-ask' instruction was over-generalized beyond memory saves to all post-plan actions, (3) Plan YAML termination only suggested /spec_kit:implement without enforcing it; solution: Three-pronged fix: AGENTS.

## 2. OVERVIEW

Diagnosed and fixed a plan-to-implementation gate bypass defect where the AI agent skipped all 3 mandatory gates (Gate 1-3) when transitioning from /spec_kit:plan to implementation via free-text request. Root cause analysis identified 3 compounding factors: (1) no phase boundary concept in Gate 3, (2) Memory Save Rule over-generalization beyond memory saves, (3) plan YAML termination was suggestion-only. Implemented fixes across AGENTS.md (Gate 3 phase boundary + Memory Save Rule scoping), plan.md (enforcement note), and both plan YAML files (enforcement blocks). Also applied AGENTS.md changes to Barter/coder variant. Created changelog files and published GitHub release v2.1.2.0. Session also included implementation of Source #6 skill reference indexing (uncommitted, separate release).

**Key Outcomes**:
- Diagnosed and fixed a plan-to-implementation gate bypass defect where the AI agent skipped all 3...
- Decision: Added PHASE BOUNDARY clause to Gate 3 rather than removing carry-over
- Decision: Scoped Memory Save Rule carry-over explicitly to memory saves only — '
- Decision: Added enforcement block to both plan YAML termination sections rather
- Decision: Committed gate enforcement separately from Source #6 indexing — keeps
- Decision: Applied identical AGENTS.

### FEATURE: Diagnosed and fixed a plan-to-implementation gate bypass defect where the AI agent skipped all 3...

Diagnosed and fixed a plan-to-implementation gate bypass defect where the AI agent skipped all 3 mandatory gates (Gate 1-3) when transitioning from /spec_kit:plan to implementation via free-text request. Root cause analysis identified 3 compounding factors: (1) no phase boundary concept in Gate 3, (2) Memory Save Rule over-generalization beyond memory saves, (3) plan YAML termination was suggestion-only. Implemented fixes across AGENTS.md (Gate 3 phase boundary + Memory Save Rule scoping), plan.md (enforcement note), and both plan YAML files (enforcement blocks). Also applied AGENTS.md changes to Barter/coder variant. Created changelog files and published GitHub release v2.1.2.0. Session also included implementation of Source #6 skill reference indexing (uncommitted, separate release).

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Three compounding factors: (1) Gate 3 had no phase boundary — once answered during planning it was permanently satisfied, (2) Memory Save Rule 'do NOT re-ask' instruction was over-generalized beyond memory saves to all post-plan actions, (3) Plan YAML termination only suggested /spec_kit:implement without enforcing it; solution: Three-pronged fix: AGENTS.md Gate 3 PHASE BOUNDARY clause (6 lines), Memory Save Rule 'for memory saves' scoping (3 lines changed), plan YAML enforcement blocks in both auto and confirm variants (7 lines each), plus plan.md enforcement blockquote; patterns: Phase boundary pattern for gate systems — gate answers are scoped to workflow phases, not conversation lifetime. Enforcement blocks in YAML termination sections as a complement to suggestion-based next_steps.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
