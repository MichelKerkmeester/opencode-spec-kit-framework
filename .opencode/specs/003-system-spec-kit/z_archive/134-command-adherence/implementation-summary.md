# Implementation Summary

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: impl-summary-core | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:metadata -->
## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 134-command-adherence |
| **Completed** | 2026-02-18 (handover-prep checkpoint) |
| **Level** | 3 |
<!-- /ANCHOR:metadata -->

<!-- ANCHOR:what-built -->
## What Was Built

Implementation work for the core gate-bypass fix is still in progress in this spec folder.
This summary file is added so validation can track implementation state without missing required artifacts.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/implementation-summary.md` | Created | Track implementation state and satisfy required Level 3 artifact checks |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep implementation status explicit as in-progress | Prevents false signal that technical work is complete while satisfying required documentation structure |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Skip | Implementation verification is pending actual code/instruction updates |
| Unit | Skip | No implementation changes recorded in this summary checkpoint |
| Integration | Skip | Full flow validation remains part of pending work |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

Implementation verification is not complete yet. This summary reflects current project state and should be updated after implementation tasks are finished.
