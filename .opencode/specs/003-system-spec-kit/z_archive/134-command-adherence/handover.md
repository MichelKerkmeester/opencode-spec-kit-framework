# Session Handover: Plan-to-Implementation Gate Bypass Fix

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: handover | v1.0 -->

---

## 1. Session Summary

- **Date:** 2026-02-18
- **Spec Folder:** `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence`
- **Attempt:** 1
- **Objective:** Preserve and continue the gate-bypass remediation work for plan-to-implementation transitions.
- **Progress Estimate:** 45%

### Key Accomplishments
- Confirmed active spec folder from latest memory activity.
- Ran strict spec validation and identified concrete blockers/warnings.
- Fixed validation issues in spec docs (AI protocol coverage, section completeness, missing implementation summary artifact).
- Re-ran validator successfully with `RESULT: PASSED`.

## 2. Current State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Phase | PLANNING / VALIDATION CLEANUP COMPLETE |
| Active File | `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/implementation-summary.md` |
| Last Action | Added missing Level 3 documentation components and re-validated spec folder |
| System State | Spec validation passes (0 errors, 0 warnings); handover prepared |

---

## 3. Completed Work

### Tasks Completed in This Session
- Loaded handover workflow config and executed setup flow.
- Auto-detected and confirmed target spec folder.
- Executed pre-handover validation.
- Applied requested "fix before handover" remediation.

### Files Modified
- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/spec.md` - Added REQ-007/REQ-008 and six Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios.
- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/plan.md` - Added AI execution protocol sections (Pre-Task Checklist, Task Execution Rules, Status Reporting Format, Blocked Task Protocol).
- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/checklist.md` - Added explicit `P0` and `P1` sections.
- `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/implementation-summary.md` - Created required artifact with current in-progress status.

### Validation Evidence
- Command run: `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh ".opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence"`
- Result: `PASSED` (all checks green).

---

## 4. Pending Work

### Immediate Next Action
> Resume implementation/verification tasks for the actual gate-bypass fix and update checklist evidence as work completes.

### Remaining Tasks (Priority Order)
1. Validate live behavior end-to-end: `/spec_kit:plan` -> free-text implement request -> enforced routing through `/spec_kit:implement`.
2. Verify regressions do not occur for Memory Save Rule carry-over and `/spec_kit:complete` single-phase behavior.
3. Mark completed checklist items with concrete evidence links/notes.
4. Finalize implementation-summary content after implementation/verification is truly complete.

### Estimated Effort
- Verification + checklist evidence: 45-90 minutes.

### Dependencies
- Stable behavior in gate enforcement text across `AGENTS.md`, plan YAMLs, and command docs.

---

## 5. Key Decisions

### Decision A: Fix validation debt before handover
- **Choice:** Address pre-handover validation issues before generating handover.
- **Rationale:** Ensures continuation starts from a clean, compliant spec state.
- **Impact:** Reduced onboarding friction for the next session.

### Decision B: Add explicit acceptance scenarios in spec
- **Choice:** Add six `**Given**` acceptance scenarios to satisfy Level 3 section-count expectations.
- **Rationale:** Makes acceptance intent explicit and machine-checkable by validator rules.
- **Impact:** Stronger verification structure for continuation.

### Decision C: Add AI protocol section to plan
- **Choice:** Add required protocol components to `plan.md` rather than spreading them loosely.
- **Rationale:** Directly satisfies AI protocol checks and clarifies execution behavior.
- **Impact:** Better execution consistency in follow-up sessions.

## 6. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None hard-blocking at handover time.

### Risks
- Risk: Enforcement changes may accidentally affect `/spec_kit:complete` behavior.
  - Mitigation: Run targeted regression scenario before declaring done.
- Risk: Checklist remains unverified if evidence is not captured immediately.
  - Mitigation: Update checklist during each verification pass, not at the end.

### Open Questions
- Should this spec be marked implementation-complete now, or after one more live behavior verification pass?

---

## 7. Continuation Instructions

### Resume Command
```text
/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence
```

### Continuation Prompt
```text
CONTINUATION - Attempt 1 | Spec: .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence | Last: Validation remediation completed and handover created | Next: Execute end-to-end enforcement/regression verification and update checklist evidence
```

### Files to Review First
1. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/spec.md` - New requirements and acceptance scenarios.
2. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/plan.md` - AI protocol execution requirements.
3. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/checklist.md` - P0/P1 verification tracking.
4. `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/134-command-adherence/implementation-summary.md` - Current implementation status placeholder-now-concrete.

### Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Load this handover file and confirm scope.
- [ ] Run live workflow verification scenarios.
- [ ] Capture evidence in checklist entries.
- [ ] Update implementation summary with final completion details.
