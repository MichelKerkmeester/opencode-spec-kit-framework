# State Simplification: Integrate State into Memory Files
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec | v1.0 -->

## 1. Overview

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Feature** | Simplify state tracking by embedding in memory files |
| **Type** | Refactoring / Simplification |
| **Priority** | High |
| **Status** | Planning |

## 2. Problem Statement

Current implementation has 3 context mechanisms:
1. quick-continue.md - Minimal handoff (~14 lines)
2. STATE.md - Project state (~50 lines)
3. memory/*.md - Full session context (~200-500 lines)

This is potentially redundant. STATE.md and memory files both capture state information.

## 3. Solution

Remove STATE.md as separate file. Instead, embed a "Project State Snapshot" section at the TOP of each memory file.

### Before
- 3 files: quick-continue.md + STATE.md + memory/*.md
- generate-context.js writes to STATE.md separately
- Resume checks STATE.md as priority 2

### After
- 2 files: quick-continue.md + memory/*.md (with embedded state)
- generate-context.js embeds state in memory file
- Resume extracts state from latest memory file
