| Metadata | Value |

| **Spec ID** | 006 |
| **Title** | Comprehensive Test Suite for Spec Kit Ecosystem |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Level** | 3 |
| **Created** | 2025-12-26 |

## Problem Statement

The Spec Kit Memory MCP and related tools lacked comprehensive testing:
- No systematic verification of MCP tools, validation scripts, or integration points
- Bugs could go undetected without proper test coverage
- No confidence in refactoring or extending the ecosystem
- Manual testing was time-consuming and inconsistent

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Test all MCP memory tools (save, search, update, delete, validate, list, stats)
- Test all MCP checkpoint tools (create, list, restore, delete)
- Test validation shell scripts (validate-spec.sh, check-files.sh, etc.)
- Test generate-context.js script for memory file creation
- Test tier behavior and constitutional memory surfacing
- Test trigger phrase matching (<50ms performance target)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- 80%+ code coverage for shell scripts
- 90%+ code coverage for Python components
- 85%+ code coverage for MCP server modules
- Test execution time <10 minutes for full suite
- CI/CD integration ready with GitHub Actions

### Integration Requirements
- End-to-end integration workflow tests
- Cross-component interaction verification
- Isolated test sandboxes to prevent conflicts

## 1. Objective

Create a comprehensive test suite covering all components of the Spec Kit ecosystem:
- Spec Kit shell scripts (11 scripts)
- Skill Advisor Python script
- Memory MCP Server (13 tools, 23 modules)
- Integration and E2E workflows

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- Unit tests for all shell scripts in `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/`
- Unit tests for skill_advisor.py
- Unit tests for all MCP server modules in `mcp_server/lib/`
- Integration tests for MCP tools
- E2E tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for trigger matching (<50ms target)

### Out of Scope
- Website-specific tests (anobel.com)
- Third-party dependency tests
- Load/stress testing

## 3. Success Criteria

- [ ] 80%+ code coverage for shell scripts
- [ ] 90%+ code coverage for skill_advisor.py
- [ ] All 13 MCP tools have integration tests
- [ ] All 23 lib modules have unit tests
- [ ] E2E tests cover full spec folder lifecycle
- [ ] CI/CD integration ready

## 4. Components

| Component | Location | Test Framework |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Spec Kit Scripts | `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/` | Bash/BATS |
| Skill Advisor | `.opencode/scripts/skill_advisor.py` | pytest |
| Memory MCP Server | `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/` | Jest |
| Integration | Cross-component | Shell + assertions |

## 5. Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ (for Jest)
- Python 3.6+ (for pytest)
- BATS (Bash Automated Testing System)
- Existing test-fixtures/ in scripts/
