title: "To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always [124-upgrade-level-script/15-02-26_15-53__upgrade-level-script]"
importance_tier: "critical"

<!-- TEMPLATE: context_template.md v2.2 - DO NOT EDIT GENERATED FILES -->
<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: No automated way to upgrade spec folder documentation levels (L1→L2→L3→L3+) — manual process was error-prone and inconsistent; solution: Created upgrade-level.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode/.../spec/upgrade-level.sh` - Script

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/README.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/core/index.ts` - Entry point / exports

- `.opencode/.../tests/test-subfolder-resolution.js` - File modified (description pending)

- `.opencode/.../124-upgrade-level-script/spec.md` - Documentation

**How to Extend**:

- Add new modules following the existing file structure patterns

- Create corresponding test files for new implementations

- Maintain consistent error handling approach

- Use established template patterns for new outputs

**Common Patterns**:

- **Helper Functions**: Encapsulate reusable logic in dedicated utility functions

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

## 2. OVERVIEW

Completed all remaining work on Spec 124 (upgrade-level.sh) and Spec 122 (prose-tightening doc fixes). Spec 124's upgrade-level.sh script (1,510 lines, 23 functions) was fully implemented, reviewed (90/100), tested (4/4 pass), and documented in a prior session. This session focused on a comprehensive 10-agent audit of Spec 122 that uncovered critical issues (inverted LOC claim, wrong documentation level, missing L3 files), followed by a 7-agent fix dispatch that corrected all spec docs (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md), created missing L3 files (implementation-summary.md, decision-record.md with 4 ADRs), fixed karabiner.json, and saved memory. Both specs remain uncommitted and ready for git commit. Recommend committing Spec 122 first due to cross-spec overlap on scripts/spec/README.md.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Completed all remaining work on Spec 124 (upgrade-level.sh) and Spec 122 (prose-tightening doc...
- Decision: Keep both specs uncommitted per user instruction — ready for git commi
- Decision: Recommend committing Spec 122 before Spec 124 due to cross-spec overla
- Decision: Spec 124 upgrade-level.
- Decision: Script supports L1→L2→L3→L3+ upgrades with --dry-run, --json, --verbos

Completed all remaining work on Spec 124 (upgrade-level.sh) and Spec 122 (prose-tightening doc fixes). Spec 124's upgrade-level.sh script (1,510 lines, 23 functions) was fully implemented, reviewed (90/100), tested (4/4 pass), and documented in a prior session. This session focused on a comprehensive 10-agent audit of Spec 122 that uncovered critical issues (inverted LOC claim, wrong documentation level, missing L3 files), followed by a 7-agent fix dispatch that corrected all spec docs (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md), created missing L3 files (implementation-summary.md, decision-record.md with 4 ADRs), fixed karabiner.json, and saved memory. Both specs remain uncommitted and ready for git commit. Recommend committing Spec 122 first due to cross-spec overlap on scripts/spec/README.md.

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: No automated way to upgrade spec folder documentation levels (L1→L2→L3→L3+) — manual process was error-prone and inconsistent; solution: Created upgrade-level.sh (1,510 lines, 23 functions) that reads current level, determines missing files from template system, creates them with proper SPECKIT_LEVEL markers, and handles edge cases like existing files and L3+ addendum sections; patterns: Template composition using core templates + level-specific addendum prefixes/suffixes. Script uses bash with heredoc templates, supports --dry-run for safe preview, --json for machine-readable output, and --keep-backups for safety. 4/4 test scenarios passing (L1→L2, L1→L3, L2→L3, same-level no-op).

Completed all remaining work on Spec 124 (upgrade-level.sh) and Spec 122 (prose-tightening doc fixes). Spec 124's upgrade-level.sh script (1,510 lines, 23 functions) was fully implemented, reviewed (90/100), tested (4/4 pass), and documented in a prior session. This session focused on a comprehensive 10-agent audit of Spec 122 that uncovered critical issues (inverted LOC claim, wrong documentation level, missing L3 files), followed by a 7-agent fix dispatch that corrected all spec docs (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md), created missing L3 files (implementation-summary.md, decision-record.md with 4 ADRs), fixed karabiner.json, and saved memory. Both specs remain uncommitted and ready for git commit. Recommend committing Spec 122 first due to cross-spec overlap on scripts/spec/README.md.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/124-upgrade-level-script` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/124-upgrade-level-script" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/124-upgrade-level-script", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/124-upgrade-level-script/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/124-upgrade-level-script --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Uncertainty | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |
| Context | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] | → |

**Learning Index:** [TBD]/100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
