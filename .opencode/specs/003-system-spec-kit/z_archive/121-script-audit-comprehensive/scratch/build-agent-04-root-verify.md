# Build Agent 04 Root Verification

Date: 2026-02-15
Source artifact: `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/121-script-audit-comprehensive/scratch/context-agent-04-root-orchestration.md`
Scope: Validate C04 findings against repository files/command references (read-only); node_modules move-only issues excluded.

## Verdict by Finding

| ID | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C04-F001 | CONFIRMED | Version mismatch exists: `SKILL.md` frontmatter `version: 2.2.8.0` vs `package.json` `"version": "1.7.2"`. |
| C04-F002 | NOT CONFIRMED | Facts are true (Task listed in `allowed-tools`, agent-dispatch section exists), but no broken reference/command drift was verified; claim is policy interpretation, not a concrete mismatch. |
| C04-F003 | NOT CONFIRMED | Constitutional files were read directly and include both frontmatter trigger lists (`triggerPhrases`) and ANCHOR tags (`<!-- ANCHOR_EXAMPLE:... -->`). |
| C04-F004 | NOT CONFIRMED | Command reference pattern is not uniform; docs include multiple valid invocation forms (e.g., `.opencode/...`, `scripts/dist/...`, `dist/...`, `../dist/...`). |
| C04-F005 | CONFIRMED | `scripts/registry-loader.sh` exists and is documented in `scripts/README.md`, but `system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` has no `registry-loader` mention. |
| C04-F006 | CONFIRMED | Hardcoded `v1.7.2` appears in `SKILL.md` and mirrors package version; drift risk claim is valid as a documentation lock risk. |
| C04-F007 | CONFIRMED | `workflows-code--opencode` skill exists; no cross-reference in `system-spec-kit/SKILL.md`. |

## Validated Commands/References

- `rg -n "generate-context\\.js" .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit -g "*.md"` returned diverse command styles, disproving single-pattern assumption.
- `grep` search equivalent via repository tooling showed no `registry-loader` nor `workflows-code--opencode` mentions in `system-spec-kit/SKILL.md`.
- Direct file reads verified constitutional metadata/anchors and cited line references.

## Counts

- validated_count: 7
- confirmed_count: 4
- top_confirmed: C04-F001, C04-F005, C04-F006
