# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Script Audit

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: spec-core + level2-verify + level3-arch | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Comprehensive audit of all system-spec-kit scripts to identify bugs, broken features, and misalignments with sk-code--opencode standards. Investigation excludes issues solely caused by ongoing node_modules relocation into mcp_server.

**Key Decisions**: Shard-based audit strategy (context → build → review), exclusion of node_modules relocation issues

**Critical Dependencies**: sk-code--opencode standards documentation

<!-- ANCHOR:problem -->
## 2. PROBLEM & PURPOSE

### Problem Statement
System-spec-kit contains multiple script directories (scripts/, shared/, mcp_server/) with complex interdependencies. Current state may contain bugs, broken features, and deviations from sk-code--opencode standards that impact reliability and maintainability.

### Purpose
Identify and document all script issues excluding those caused solely by ongoing node_modules relocation, creating a comprehensive remediation roadmap.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:scope -->
## 3. SCOPE

### In Scope
- Audit all scripts in system-spec-kit/scripts/
- Audit all scripts in system-spec-kit/shared/
- Audit all scripts in system-spec-kit/mcp_server/
- Compare against sk-code--opencode standards
- Document bugs, broken features, and misalignments
- Exclude node_modules relocation-related issues

### Scope Paths
- `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit`
- `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts`
- `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/shared`
- `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server`
- Comparison target: `/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/sk-code--opencode`

### Out of Scope
- Issues caused SOLELY by ongoing node_modules relocation into mcp_server - excluded per requirements
- Implementation of fixes (separate spec folders)
- Non-script documentation files

### Files to Audit

| Directory | Script Count | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| scripts/ | TBD | Core spec management scripts |
| shared/ | TBD | Shared utility scripts |
| mcp_server/ | TBD | MCP server-specific scripts |

<!-- /ANCHOR:requirements -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:success-criteria -->
## 5. SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **SC-001**: All scripts in scope audited with findings documented
- **SC-002**: Node_modules relocation issues identified and excluded
- **SC-003**: Comparison matrix against sk-code--opencode completed

<!-- ANCHOR:risks -->
## 6. RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

| Type | Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------|--------|------------|
| Dependency | sk-code--opencode standards | Cannot validate alignment | Document as is, validate later |
| Risk | False positives from node_modules relocation | Wasted effort | Strict exclusion filter |
| Risk | Scope creep into fixes | Delays audit completion | Document only, no fixes |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risks -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:nfr -->
## 7. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### Performance
- **NFR-P01**: Audit completion within reasonable timeframe using shard-based approach

### Security
- **NFR-S01**: No exposure of sensitive data in audit findings

### Reliability
- **NFR-R01**: Reproducible audit results with documented methodology
<!-- /ANCHOR:nfr -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:edge-cases -->
## 8. EDGE CASES

### Data Boundaries
- Empty script directories: Document as "no scripts found"
- Unreadable scripts: Flag as "access error"

### Error Scenarios
- Node_modules relocation in progress: Exclude from findings
- Standards document unavailable: Proceed with best-practices baseline

## 11. USER STORIES

### US-001: Script Bug Identification (Priority: P0)

**As a** maintainer, **I want** all script bugs documented, **so that** I can prioritize remediation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given all scripts in scope, When audit runs, Then bugs are identified and categorized
2. Given node_modules relocation, When filtering issues, Then relocation-only issues are excluded

---

### US-002: Standards Alignment Check (Priority: P0)

**As a** maintainer, **I want** scripts compared against sk-code--opencode, **so that** deviations are identified.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given sk-code--opencode standards, When comparing scripts, Then misalignments are documented with specific examples
<!-- /ANCHOR:user-stories -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:questions -->
## 12. OPEN QUESTIONS

- What is the exact scope of "node_modules relocation issues" to exclude?
- Are there specific sk-code--opencode standards documents to reference?
- Should findings be categorized by remediation effort estimate?
