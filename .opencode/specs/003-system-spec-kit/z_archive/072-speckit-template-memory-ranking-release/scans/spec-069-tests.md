## Test Files in Spec 069 Folder

### Core Test Suite Files

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/test-detector.js
TESTS: Complexity detection, dimension scoring, weight verification, level mapping
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 12:22
STATUS: relevant
REASON: Tests complexity scoring system (31 tests). Directly relevant because memory ranking in 072 will need similar scoring logic for context importance classification.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/test-classifier.js
TESTS: Level boundary thresholds, distance calculations, feature availability, gate expressions
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 12:22
STATUS: relevant
REASON: Tests level classification boundaries (49 tests). Relevant because 072's tier classification (HOT/WARM/COLD) follows similar boundary logic.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/test-marker-parser.js
TESTS: COMPLEXITY_GATE parsing, condition evaluation, auto-enable features
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 12:22
STATUS: partially-relevant
REASON: Tests marker parsing (49 tests). Only relevant if 072 uses similar conditional markers in memory templates.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/test-preprocessor.js
TESTS: Template loading, preprocessing, metadata injection, expansion
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 11:21
STATUS: partially-relevant
REASON: Tests template processing (26 tests). Relevant patterns for 072's memory template handling but may need adaptation.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/test-cli.sh
TESTS: CLI scripts (detect-complexity.js, expand-template.js)
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 12:23
STATUS: partially-relevant
REASON: Shell-based CLI tests (16 tests). Pattern may be reusable for testing 072's memory ranking CLI tools.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/specs/003-memory-and-spec-kit/069-speckit-template-complexity/tests/run-tests.sh
TESTS: Test suite runner with colored output, aggregation, and reporting
LAST MODIFIED: 2026-01-16 12:23
STATUS: relevant
REASON: Test harness for running all tests. Excellent reusable pattern for 072's test suite.

## Test Files in System-Spec-Kit (MCP Server)

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/tier-classifier.test.js
TESTS: HOT/WARM/COLD tier classification
STATUS: highly-relevant
REASON: DIRECTLY tests the tier classification system that 072 is built on. This is the existing test file for the tier classification logic.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/attention-decay.test.js
TESTS: Attention decay scoring (time-based decay)
STATUS: highly-relevant
REASON: Tests attention decay mechanism used in tier ranking. Core component of 072's memory ranking system.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/co-activation.test.js
TESTS: Co-activation scoring (semantic relationships)
STATUS: highly-relevant
REASON: Tests co-activation mechanism for related memories. Core component of 072's ranking system.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/working-memory.test.js
TESTS: Working memory management (capacity, eviction, priority)
STATUS: highly-relevant
REASON: Tests the working memory system that 072 integrates with. Essential for integration testing.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/summary-generator.test.js
TESTS: Memory summary generation
STATUS: relevant
REASON: Tests summary generation logic. May be useful for testing 072's memory content processing.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/tests/modularization.test.js
TESTS: Modularization and module structure
STATUS: needs-review
REASON: Tests module structure. May contain organizational patterns useful for 072.

## Test Files in System-Spec-Kit (Scripts)

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-bug-fixes.js
TESTS: Bug fixes verification
STATUS: needs-review
REASON: Tests specific bug fixes. Review to see if any relate to tier classification or memory ranking.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-embeddings-factory.js
TESTS: Embeddings factory creation and configuration
STATUS: relevant
REASON: Tests embedding provider setup. Relevant for 072's semantic similarity calculations.

FILE: /Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Websites/anobel.com/.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/tests/test-validation.sh
TESTS: Spec folder validation
STATUS: partially-relevant
REASON: Shell-based validation tests. Pattern may be useful for 072's validation needs.

## Recommendations for Spec 072

1. **Reuse Test Patterns**:
   - Copy run-tests.sh harness structure
   - Adapt test-detector.js patterns for importance scoring
   - Use test-classifier.js boundary testing approach

2. **Extend Existing Tests**:
   - Add 072-specific tests to tier-classifier.test.js
   - Extend attention-decay.test.js for new decay functions
   - Add integration tests with working-memory.test.js

3. **Create New Tests**:
   - Test memory_search() with tier filtering
   - Test template ranking insertion
   - Test boundary conditions for HOT/WARM/COLD tiers
   - Test decay + co-activation scoring combination

4. **Test Organization**:
   - Keep 072 tests in spec folder during development
   - Move to system-spec-kit after verification
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing tests

## Next Steps

1. Run existing MCP server tests to establish baseline
2. Review tier-classifier.test.js for current coverage
3. Identify gaps between 069 patterns and 072 needs
4. Create 072 test plan based on findings
5. Implement new tests following 069 patterns
