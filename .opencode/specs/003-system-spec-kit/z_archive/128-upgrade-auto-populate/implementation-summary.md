## What Was Built

Demonstrated the AI auto-populate workflow by upgrading spec 128 from Level 1 to Level 3+ and then fully populating all template placeholder sections with context-derived content. This serves as both the specification of the auto-populate feature and a proof-of-concept demonstrating the workflow in action. Six documents were created/populated: spec.md (17 sections), plan.md (full L2/L3/L3+ structure), checklist.md (spec-specific items), decision-record.md (2 ADRs), tasks.md (19 tasks across 4 phases), and implementation-summary.md.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| spec.md | Modified | Upgraded from L1 to L3+ with all sections auto-populated |
| plan.md | Created | Full implementation plan with L2/L3/L3+ addendum sections |
| checklist.md | Modified | Replaced generic items with spec-specific verification checks |
| decision-record.md | Modified | Populated with 2 ADRs (workflow approach, missing context handling) |
| tasks.md | Created | Real task breakdown across 4 implementation phases |
| implementation-summary.md | Created | This document - documenting the implementation results |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| AI-side workflow (not script modification) | Shell scripts cannot reason about content; AI agents can read context and derive accurate population |
| N/A for missing source context | Accuracy over completeness; explicit gaps are better than fabricated content |
| Full rewrite of spec.md after upgrade | L2->L3 upgrade was skipped due to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY false positive; manual restructuring needed |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | All populated content reviewed for accuracy against spec context |
| Placeholder grep | Pass | Grep scan for `[placeholder]` patterns returns zero unfilled placeholders |
| Diff review | Pass | Original sections 1-6 preserved; only template sections populated |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

- The `upgrade-level.sh` L2->L3 step is skipped when spec.md already contains `EXECUTIVE SUMMARY` (false positive on idempotency check). This required manually restructuring spec.md to include the missing L3 sections (Risk Matrix, User Stories). This bug should be tracked as a separate fix.
- Auto-populate is currently a manual AI workflow; integration into `/spec_kit:complete` as an automated post-upgrade step is future work.
- The approach requires the AI agent to understand template structure and placeholder patterns; there is no programmatic detection of which sections were injected by the upgrade script.

## Bugs Found During Implementation

| Bug | Severity | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `EXECUTIVE SUMMARY` false positive skips L2->L3 spec.md injection | High | Known; documented in spec section 17 as separate fix needed |
| `plan.md` not created by upgrade script when it doesn't exist pre-upgrade | Medium | By design; upgrade only modifies existing files |
