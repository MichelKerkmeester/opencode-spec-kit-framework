# 048: SpecKit & Memory System Remediation

> **Level**: 3 (Complex - Architectural implications)
> **Status**: Planning Complete
> **Created**: 2025-12-30
> **Parent Analysis**: `analysis.md`

## 1. Problem Statement

A comprehensive audit of the SpecKit and Memory systems identified **16 verified bugs**, **10 alignment issues**, and **9 improvement opportunities** (35 total tasks). While the systems are fundamentally well-designed, several high-severity bugs require immediate attention to prevent crashes and data loss.

> **Note**: 7 findings were verified as false positives and removed (BUG-M2, BUG-M5, BUG-L1, BUG-L4, BUG-L5, BUG-L7, ALIGN-5).

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

| ID | Issue | Impact |
|----|-------|--------|
| BUG-H1 | `retry-manager.js` null check missing | **Crash** if database not initialized |
| BUG-H2 | `retry-manager.js` null check missing | **Crash** if database not initialized |
| BUG-H3 | `generate-context.js` undefined variable | **Error handling fails** |
| BUG-H4 | `validate-spec-folder.js` incomplete | **Validation inconsistent** |

---

## 2. Success Criteria

### Must Have (P0)
- [ ] All HIGH severity bugs fixed and tested
- [ ] Tier filtering returns correct results
- [ ] No crashes on database access patterns
- [ ] Error handling works in all catch blocks

### Should Have (P1)
- [ ] All MEDIUM severity bugs fixed
- [ ] Documentation aligned with implementation
- [ ] Security improvements implemented
- [ ] Performance quick wins applied

### Nice to Have (P2)
- [ ] All LOW severity bugs fixed
- [ ] UX improvements implemented
- [ ] Technical debt addressed

## 3. Scope

### In Scope

| Category | Items | Count |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Bug Fixes | HIGH + MEDIUM + LOW severity | 16 |
| Alignment | Documentation vs Implementation | 10 |
| Security | Config improvements | 2 |
| Performance | Quick wins | 4 |
| UX | Improvements from analysis | 3 |

### Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Template-Reality Gap | Intentional design - templates are aspirational |
| Two Semantic Systems | Requires major refactoring (separate spec) |
| Test Fixtures Creation | Separate spec folder needed |
| Major Performance Refactoring | Embedding generation is model-bound |

---

## 4. Work Streams

| WS | Name | Tasks | Priority |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| WS1 | MCP Server Core | 6 | P0-P1 |
| WS2 | Scripts | 6 | P0-P1 |
| WS3 | Trigger & Search | 1 | P2 |
| WS4 | Commands & Assets | 1 | P1 |
| WS5 | Documentation | 11 | P1-P2 |
| WS6 | Memory Files | 2 | P2 |
| WS7 | MCP Operations | 1 | P2 |
| WS8 | Security & Config | 3 | P1-P2 |
| WS9 | UX Improvements | 4 | P2 |

---

## 5. Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Regression in core functionality | Medium | High | Comprehensive checklist, incremental commits |
| Breaking existing memory files | Low | High | Backward compatible changes only |
| Documentation drift continues | Medium | Medium | Automated validation in CI |
| Performance degradation | Low | Medium | Benchmark before/after |

---

## 6. Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- None (all changes are internal to SpecKit/Memory systems)

### Internal Dependencies
| Work Stream | Depends On |
|-------------|------------|
| WS3 (Trigger) | WS1 (MCP Core) |
| WS7 (MCP Ops) | WS1 (MCP Core) |
| WS5 (Docs) | WS1-WS4 (fixes complete first) |
| WS9 (UX) | WS1-WS5 (stable base first) |

---

## 7. Estimated Effort

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 1 day | Critical fixes (P0) |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 days | Medium fixes + alignment (P1) |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 days | Low fixes + UX (P2) |
| Phase 4 | Ongoing | Technical debt |

**Total Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days
