# Phase Package Spec: Foundation (Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 1.5)

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-spec | v1.1 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:executive-summary -->
## Executive Summary

This package defines the foundation and hardening work required before extraction/rollout implementation begins. It covers prerequisite infrastructure, core cognitive automation, and hard-gate validation.

Primary outcome: produce reliable go/no-go artifacts for Phase 2.

## 2. Scope Boundaries

### In Scope
- Phase 0 prerequisites and sign-off (`T000a-T000l`, `CHK-125-129`).
- Phase 1 core automation and indicative validation (`T001-T028`, `CHK-130-139`).
- Phase 1.5 hardening gate (`T027a-T027o`, `CHK-155-159b`).
- Requirement slice: `REQ-001-006`, `REQ-009-012`, `REQ-014-017`.

### Out of Scope
- Phase 2 extraction and causal boost implementation.
- Phase 3 rollout and user telemetry rollout controls.
- QP memory-quality stream (`TQ001-TQ047`) except explicit dependency notes.

## 3. Requirement Mapping (Package Slice)

| Priority | Requirement IDs | Package Interpretation |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| P0 | `REQ-001-005`, `REQ-011-012`, `REQ-016-017` | Must pass before Phase 2 can start; this package is primary owner for `REQ-017` |
| P1 | `REQ-006`, `REQ-009-010`, `REQ-014-015` | Required unless user-approved deferral; this package is primary owner for `REQ-014` |

This package does not redefine requirements; it scopes root requirements to foundation execution and owns acceptance for overlapping requirements `REQ-014` and `REQ-017`.

## 4. Root Mapping

| Root Artifact | Coverage in this Package |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| `../spec.md` | Scope sections + requirement subset above |
| `../plan.md` | Foundation architecture and hard-gate flow |
| `../tasks.md` | `T000a-T028`, `T027a-T027o` |
| `../checklist.md` | `CHK-125-139`, `CHK-155-159b` |

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-targets -->
## 5. Acceptance Targets

| Target | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Phase 0 dataset bootstrap | 100 real queries with baseline + coverage sanity checks |
| Hardening dataset expansion | 1000-query set complete before Phase 2 |
| Rank stability gate | Spearman correlation >= 0.90 on 1000-query eval |
| Redaction calibration gate | False-positive rate <= 15% on 50 real Bash outputs |
| Session lifecycle contract | New-session reset and resume-counter behavior verified by integration test |

## 6. Dependencies and Handoffs

- Blocks `../002-extraction-rollout-phases-2-3/` until `T027o` go/no-go passes.
- Provides hardened input artifacts:
  - `../scratch/eval-dataset-1000.json`
  - `../scratch/phase1-5-eval-results.md`
  - `../scratch/redaction-calibration.md`
- Runs in parallel with package `../003-memory-quality-qp-0-4/` where no hardening dependency exists.

<!-- ANCHOR:governance -->
## 7. Governance (Level 3+ Package Rules)

- This package is Level 3+ planning documentation.
- `decision-record.md` present as delegation stub; canonical ADRs at `../decision-record.md`.
- `implementation-summary.md` present as compliance normalization record; substantive summary at `../implementation-summary.md`.
- Root documents remain source-of-truth for completion claims.

## 8. Status Statement

Planning-only package. No implementation tasks are marked complete in this file set.

<!-- ANCHOR:problem-statement -->
## Problem Statement

Package `001-foundation-phases-0-1-1-5` must produce trustworthy prerequisite and hardening evidence so package `002-extraction-rollout-phases-2-3` does not start on unstable assumptions. Without explicit foundation gates, later extraction and rollout work can inherit dataset bias, redaction over-filtering, or session-lifecycle regressions.
<!-- /ANCHOR:problem-statement -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:requirements -->
## Requirements

The package uses root requirements as binding constraints for this scope slice:

- `REQ-001`: prerequisite wiring is in place before Phase 1 progression.
- `REQ-002`: callback and lifecycle flow are stable under expected runtime conditions.
- `REQ-003`: routing behavior remains deterministic under the defined gate sequence.
- `REQ-004`: baseline observability and trace signals exist for prerequisite checks.
- `REQ-005`: prerequisite completion criteria are explicit and auditable.
- `REQ-006`: dependent package handoff boundaries are explicit.
- `REQ-009`: shadow-evaluation gating is present before rollout work.
- `REQ-010`: stability checks are retained across phase boundaries.
- `REQ-011`: session behavior contract is enforced for continuation and resume.
- `REQ-012`: pressure and safety checks are represented in package outputs.
- `REQ-014`: hook-pipeline operational readiness is consumed by downstream package 002.
- `REQ-015`: operational risk notes remain synchronized with root artifacts.
- `REQ-016`: hardening gate criteria are explicit and measurable.
- `REQ-017`: redaction calibration gate is complete before Phase 2 handoff.

<!-- ANCHOR:acceptance-scenarios -->
## Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** Phase 0 prerequisite tasks are complete, **When** package readiness is reviewed, **Then** `T000l` sign-off evidence exists in mapped root artifacts.
2. **Given** the 1000-query hardening dataset is generated, **When** correlation is computed, **Then** Spearman correlation is `>= 0.90` before handoff.
3. **Given** redaction calibration output is available, **When** false-positive rate is measured on 50 real Bash outputs, **Then** the result is `<= 15%`.
4. **Given** session lifecycle contract tests run, **When** new-session and resume paths are exercised, **Then** reset and resume-counter behavior matches package scope.
5. **Given** package 002 requests handoff artifacts, **When** dependency checks execute, **Then** `eval-dataset-1000.json`, `phase1-5-eval-results.md`, and `redaction-calibration.md` are referenced and available.
6. **Given** root references are synchronized, **When** this package is reviewed against `../spec.md`, `../plan.md`, `../tasks.md`, and `../checklist.md`, **Then** no conflicting ownership or gate definitions are found.
