# Decision Record: Post-Research Wave 3 (Outcome Confirmation)

<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: phase-package-decision-record | v1.1 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:delegation -->
## Decision Record Delegation

This phase package delegates decision records to the parent spec folder.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Canonical Source | `../decision-record.md` |
| Reason | Phase packages do not maintain independent ADRs; all architectural decisions are recorded at root level to prevent fragmentation |
| Package Scope | `006-post-research-wave-3-outcome-confirmation` |

### Package-Relevant Decisions (Root Cross-References)

Decisions relevant to this wave's scope (user survey outcomes, KPI closure, capability truth matrix):

- **ADR-001 through ADR-006**: See `../decision-record.md` for full records
- **Post-research wave model**: Documented in `../spec.md` §3.7 and `../plan.md` §2.7
- **Wave 3 capability ownership**: Frozen per `../plan.md` REQUIREMENT OWNERSHIP MATRIX
- **Wave 3 entry gate**: Requires Wave 2 dark-launch + staged rollout evidence and mutation ledger artifacts

<!-- ANCHOR:context -->
## Context

Wave 3 confirms outcomes using evidence generated by earlier waves. To keep closure criteria stable, architectural and governance ADRs stay centralized in the root decision record while this package tracks wave-specific linkage.
<!-- /ANCHOR:context -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:decision -->
## Decision

Use `../decision-record.md` as the canonical decision source and keep this package decision record as a scoped mapping of Wave 3 entry and closure conditions.
<!-- /ANCHOR:decision -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:consequences -->
## Consequences

- Preserves one authoritative ADR stream across all post-research waves.
- Requires Wave 3 docs to track root decision updates for closure consistency.
- Keeps package-level traceability without duplicating full ADR content.
