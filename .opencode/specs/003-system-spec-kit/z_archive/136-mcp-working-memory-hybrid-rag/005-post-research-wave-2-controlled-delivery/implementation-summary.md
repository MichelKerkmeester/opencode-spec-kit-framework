## Metadata

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Spec Folder** | 005-post-research-wave-2-controlled-delivery |
| **Completed** | 2026-02-19 |
| **Level** | 3+ |

## What Was Built

Wave 2 controlled-delivery outputs are documented as complete in this package. Existing task evidence covers dark-launch proof, staged rollout gate evidence, and append-only mutation-ledger integrity verification.

This summary file is added to satisfy required spec-folder structure and to record the already-documented completion state without changing package scope.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| implementation-summary.md | Created | Add required implementation summary for Level 3+ package compliance |
<!-- /ANCHOR:what-built -->

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Preserve existing Wave 2 intent and evidence references as-is | Keep this update compliance-focused and avoid speculative rewrites |
| Record completion from existing package artifacts instead of re-documenting implementation details | Tasks and checklist already contain rollout and auditability evidence |
<!-- /ANCHOR:decisions -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | Spec folder now includes required implementation-summary.md |
| Unit | Skip | No runtime code changes in this compliance-only update |
| Integration | Skip | No runtime code changes in this compliance-only update |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

This summary references existing evidence captured in package tasks and checklist; no new runtime validation artifacts were generated in this compliance-only update. For the substantive project-wide implementation summary, see `../implementation-summary.md`.
