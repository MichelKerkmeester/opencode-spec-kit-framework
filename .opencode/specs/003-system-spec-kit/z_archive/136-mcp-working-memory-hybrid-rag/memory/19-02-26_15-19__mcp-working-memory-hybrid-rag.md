<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: The post-research backlog existed but execution docs still had partial generic phrasing, making technical ownership and cross-wave handoffs ambiguous for implementation agents.

**How to Extend**:

- Apply validation patterns to new input handling

- Maintain consistent error handling approach

- Use established template patterns for new outputs

**Common Patterns**:

- **Validation**: Input validation before processing

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Async/Await**: Handle asynchronous operations cleanly

- **Functional Transforms**: Use functional methods for data transformation

## 2. OVERVIEW

Updated spec folder 136 to make the post-research rollout technically execution-ready. The root docs and wave packages now explicitly map the eight upgrade capabilities (adaptive fusion, typed trace envelope, artifact-aware routing, mutation ledger, sync/async durability, degraded-mode contracts, deterministic exact-operation tools, capability truth matrix) across Wave 1-3 backlog ownership. Existing phase package 002 was converted into an explicit historical handoff contract to waves 004, 005, and 006 while preserving prior evidence. Validation passed with zero errors and zero warnings.

**Key Outcomes**:
- Updated spec folder 136 to make the post-research rollout technically execution-ready. The root...
- Decision: Keep wave backlog ownership fixed to C136-08/C136-09/C136-10/C136-12/C
- Decision: Encode technical capability ownership directly in root and package doc
- Decision: Treat package 002 as closed historical execution evidence plus transit
- Decision: Require spec validation after synchronization and keep placeholder-fre

## 3. DETAILED CHANGES

<!-- ANCHOR:files-spec-folder-136-make-1346f205 -->
### FEATURE: Updated spec folder 136 to make the post-research rollout technically execution-ready. The root...

Updated spec folder 136 to make the post-research rollout technically execution-ready. The root docs and wave packages now explicitly map the eight upgrade capabilities (adaptive fusion, typed trace envelope, artifact-aware routing, mutation ledger, sync/async durability, degraded-mode contracts, deterministic exact-operation tools, capability truth matrix) across Wave 1-3 backlog ownership. Existing phase package 002 was converted into an explicit historical handoff contract to waves 004, 005, and 006 while preserving prior evidence. Validation passed with zero errors and zero warnings.

**Details:** post-research wave mapping | adaptive hybrid fusion | typed retrieval trace envelope | artifact-aware routing policy | append-only mutation ledger | sync async durable background jobs | typed degraded-mode contracts | deterministic exact-operation tools | capability truth matrix | C136 wave ownership
<!-- /ANCHOR:files-spec-folder-136-make-1346f205 -->

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation-technical-implementation-details-fcea2ad6 -->
### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: The post-research backlog existed but execution docs still had partial generic phrasing, making technical ownership and cross-wave handoffs ambiguous for implementation agents.; solution: Synchronized root and package docs so each wave owns explicit runtime capabilities and evidence contracts, and converted package 002 into a clear historical-to-wave transition bridge.; patterns: Root-to-package mapping sync, capability-to-backlog binding, checklist evidence tightening, and validation-first documentation workflow.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume 003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la 003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js 003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
