<!-- Constitutional Tier Promotion:
  To promote a memory to constitutional tier (always surfaced):
  
  1. Via MCP tool after indexing:
     memory_update({ id: <memory_id>, importanceTier: 'constitutional' })
  
  2. Criteria for constitutional:
     - Applies to ALL future conversations (not project-specific)
     - Core constraints/rules that should NEVER be forgotten
     - ~2000 token budget total for constitutional tier
     
  3. Add trigger phrases for proactive surfacing:
     memory_update({ 
       id: <memory_id>, 
       importanceTier: 'constitutional',
       triggerPhrases: ['fix', 'implement', 'create', 'modify', ...]
     })
     
  4. Examples of constitutional content:
     - "Always ask Gate 3 spec folder question before file modifications"
     - "Never modify production data directly"
     - "Memory files MUST use generate-context.js script"

## 1. IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**What Was Built**:

- **This session finalized the public release documentation pass for the hybrid memory rollout and...** - This session finalized the public release documentation pass for the hybrid memory rollout and aligned release-facing READMEs with the latest memory capabilities.

- **Technical Implementation Details** - rootCause: Release-facing READMEs had stale counts and incomplete coverage of newly shipped memory capabilities, and one README diverged from updated template section flow.

**Key Files and Their Roles**:

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/README.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/README.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/README.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/SKILL.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/changelog/00--opencode-environment/v2.2.0.1.md` - Documentation

- `PUBLIC_RELEASE.md` - Documentation

- `.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/nodes/gate-3-integration.md` - Documentation

**How to Extend**:

- Use established template patterns for new outputs

- Apply validation patterns to new input handling

**Common Patterns**:

- **Validation**: Input validation before processing

- **Template Pattern**: Use templates with placeholder substitution

- **Graceful Fallback**: Provide sensible defaults when primary method fails

## 2. OVERVIEW

This session finalized the public release documentation pass for the hybrid memory rollout and aligned release-facing READMEs with the latest memory capabilities. Work included auditing system-spec-kit and mcp_server READMEs against HVR and the current README template, correcting stale metrics and defaults, documenting typed retrieval contracts and artifact-aware routing, and publishing the v2.2.0.1 public release with tag and changelog updates. A follow-up structural pass added FAQ sections and moved MCP Quick Start to section 2 so both docs match the template flow while retaining excellent validator and DQI scores.

**Key Outcomes**:
- This session finalized the public release documentation pass for the hybrid memory rollout and...
- Decision: Use spec folder 003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag
- Decision: Patch README content for freshness first (feature coverage, test total
- Decision: Publish a patch release v2.
- Decision: Run strict documentation validation and HVR checks after each README c
- Decision: Reorder MCP README sections to put Quick Start at section 2 and add FA
- Technical Implementation Details

### IMPLEMENTATION: Technical Implementation Details

rootCause: Release-facing READMEs had stale counts and incomplete coverage of newly shipped memory capabilities, and one README diverged from updated template section flow.; solution: Performed targeted documentation audit, patched stale values and missing feature descriptions, removed HVR punctuation violations, added FAQ sections, reordered MCP README sections, then revalidated with validate_document and structure extraction checks.; patterns: Patch in small verifiable batches, validate after each batch, keep release metadata and changelog versions synchronized, and enforce template and HVR compliance before final save.

## RECOVERY HINTS

**Diagnostic guidance for common session recovery scenarios.**

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Symptoms | Recovery Action |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Context Loss | Agent doesn't remember prior work | Run `/spec_kit:resume ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag` |
| State Mismatch | Files don't match expected state | Verify with `git status` and `git diff` |
| Memory Not Found | Search returns no results | Check `memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag" })` |
| Stale Context | Information seems outdated | Check `last_accessed_epoch` vs current time |
| Incomplete Handover | Missing continuation context | Review CONTINUE SESSION section above |
| Dedup Collision | Wrong memory surfaced | Check `fingerprint_hash` for conflicts |

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check memory index health
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server/lib/storage/checkpoints.ts --status

# List memories for this spec folder
memory_search({ specFolder: "../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag", limit: 10 })

# Verify memory file integrity
ls -la ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag/memory/

# Check for orphaned memories
memory_search({ query: "orphaned", anchors: ["state"] })

# Force re-index of this spec folder
node .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/dist/memory/generate-context.js ../.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag --force
```

### Recovery Priority

1. **Verify spec folder exists** - Check path is correct
2. **Load memory context** - Use memory_search to surface prior work
3. **Review last session state** - Check PROJECT STATE SNAPSHOT
4. **Validate pending tasks** - Review CONTINUE SESSION section
5. **Resume with handover prompt** - Use continuation template above

### Session Integrity Checks

| Check | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Memory File Exists |  |  |
| Index Entry Valid |  | Last indexed:  |
| Checksums Match |  |  |
| No Dedup Conflicts |  |  |

## POSTFLIGHT LEARNING DELTA

**Epistemic state comparison showing knowledge gained during session.**

<!-- Delta Calculation Formulas:
  DELTA_KNOW_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_KNOW_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE = PREFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE - POSTFLIGHT_UNCERTAINTY_SCORE (positive = reduction, which is good)
  DELTA_CONTEXT_SCORE = POSTFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE - PREFLIGHT_CONTEXT_SCORE (positive = improvement)
  DELTA_*_TREND = "↑" if delta > 0, "↓" if delta < 0, "→" if delta == 0
-->

| Metric | Before | After | Delta | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knowledge |  |  |  | → |
| Uncertainty |  |  |  | → |
| Context |  |  |  | → |

**Learning Index:** /100

> Learning Index = (Knowledge Delta × 0.4) + (Uncertainty Reduction × 0.35) + (Context Improvement × 0.25)
> Higher is better. Target: ≥25 for productive sessions.

**Gaps Closed:**

- No gaps explicitly closed during session

**New Gaps Discovered:**

- No new gaps discovered

**Session Learning Summary:**
Learning metrics will be calculated when both preflight and postflight data are provided.
