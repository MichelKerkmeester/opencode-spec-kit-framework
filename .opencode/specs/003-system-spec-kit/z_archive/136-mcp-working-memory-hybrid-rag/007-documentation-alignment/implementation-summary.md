## What Was Built

This package remains a completed documentation-alignment phase for post-research Waves 1 through 3. The documented task set covers top-level skill docs, MCP server docs, library READMEs, memory command docs, and script README inventory updates.

This compliance update adds the required implementation summary and keeps the existing package intent and completion evidence unchanged.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| implementation-summary.md | Modified | Add post-completion drift addendum and resolved-status note |
| decision-record.md | Modified | Add ADR-007-005 and closure note for legacy embedding-provider drift item |
| tasks.md | Modified | Add T050 post-completion drift addendum task and resolution note |
| checklist.md | Modified | Add CHK-328 evidence links and resolved-status reference |

### Post-Completion Addendum

Follow-up investigation had recorded a documentation/runtime drift item: `tests/embeddings.vitest.ts` referenced missing module path `lib/interfaces/embedding-provider` as a deferred placeholder, while current provider architecture already lived in shared paths.

That drift item is now resolved in root spec 136 documentation: `tests/embeddings.vitest.ts` was rewritten to current shared architecture and the deferred `describe.skip` marker was removed (`npm run test --workspace=mcp_server -- tests/embeddings.vitest.ts` -> 1 file passed, 13 tests passed, 0 skipped).

Closure now also captures skip-reduction evidence for three additional suites that had been previously deferred: `tests/api-key-validation.vitest.ts`, `tests/api-validation.vitest.ts`, and `tests/lazy-loading.vitest.ts` now run as active tests (targeted run: 3 files passed, 15 tests passed, 0 skipped). Root all-features verification reflects current totals: 142 passed test files (142 total), 4415 passed tests, 19 skipped (4434 total).

This package remains complete for its original scope. The addendum now serves as historical traceability plus explicit closure linkage to root spec 136 evidence updates.

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep checklist content and completion state intact while removing validator-breaking literal anchor text | Resolve anchor-validation error without changing task intent or evidence claims |
| Keep this pass limited to compliance fixes only | Avoid scope creep outside requested error-level remediation |
| Record embedding-provider drift as an addendum, not a package reopen | Preserve completed package scope while documenting the drift lifecycle and later closure |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | Post-completion addendum recorded in decision/task/checklist/summary docs, including deferred-suite activation evidence sync |
| Unit | Skip | Documentation-only compliance update |
| Integration | Skip | Documentation-only compliance update |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

Warning-level checklist evidence-format and section-shape findings may remain; this pass targets only ERROR-level validator failures.
