# Session Handover: Spec 136 — MCP Working Memory + Hybrid RAG

**Continuation**: CONTINUATION - Attempt 3
**Spec Folder**: `.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag`
**Updated**: 2026-02-19
**Previous Attempt**: Attempt 2 (2026-02-19) — Full implementation closure, lint + test + eval pass, all automatable tasks closed; rollout/survey/KPI items administratively closed per user directive

---

## 1. Objective & Status Snapshot

**Objective**: Implement a working-memory + hybrid RAG automation layer for the Spec Kit MCP server, covering session boost, causal boost, event decay, extraction pipeline, rollout policy, and a full quality-gate closure pass (Phase 0 → Phase 3).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Overall Phase** | FULLY CLOSED — all tasks and completion criteria checked |
| **Spec Level** | 3+ |
| **Completion** | 100% — all root tasks, completion criteria, and package tasks checked |
| **Remaining work** | None. Rollout/survey/KPI items administratively closed per user directive (not newly executed operationally) |
| **Validator** | ✅ PASS — 0 errors, 0 warnings |
| **Test suite** | ✅ 133 passed files / 4271 passed tests (as of 2026-02-19) |
| **Last confirmed pass** | 2026-02-19 |

The previous handover (Attempt 2) recorded the spec as implementation-complete with rollout/survey/KPI items listed as time-gated open work. Those items have since been administratively closed per user directive — they are checked in `tasks.md`, `checklist.md`, and all package-level docs, but were not newly executed operationally. The spec is now fully consistent: all completion criteria are `[x]`, all phase tasks are `[x]`, and the validator reports 0 errors / 0 warnings.

### 2.5 Latest Session Delta (Attempt 3)

**Wording-consistency cleanup in root `tasks.md`** — no functional changes; all task states already `[x]`.

| Location | Change |
|----------|--------|
| `tasks.md` Completion Criteria — "All P0 tasks" line | Appended status note: *"administratively closed per user directive."* |
| `tasks.md` Completion Criteria — "No `[B]` blocked tasks" line | Appended status note clarifying that prior blocked gates resolved via GO packets and rollout/human-signoff tasks subsequently closed. |
| `tasks.md` Completion Criteria — "User satisfaction" line | Appended status note: *"administratively closed per user directive; see `scratch/phase3-user-survey-results.md`."* |
| `tasks.md` Completion Criteria — "100% rollout complete" line | Appended status note: *"administratively closed per user directive."* |
| `tasks.md` TASK #62 completion line | Minor wording fix for internal consistency. |
| `tasks.md` TASK #63 completion line | Minor wording fix for internal consistency. |

No code, test, or evaluation artifacts changed. This handover is updated to reflect the now-fully-checked documentation state.

## 4. Expected stderr Noise vs Actual Failures

When running `npm test` in `mcp_server`, the test output intentionally includes warning/error-like stderr lines from **negative-path tests**. These are **not failures**. Distinguishing signals:

| Pattern | Classification | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| `[WARN] tokenUsage not provided...` in test output | ✅ Expected — tests the WARN log path | None |
| `Error: path traversal blocked` or similar security boundary errors | ✅ Expected — negative-path tests asserting rejection | None |
| `SafeDB: closed — returning safe default` | ✅ Expected — closed-DB fallback behavior under test | None |
| `[ERROR] Extraction adapter failed` in extraction-adapter tests | ✅ Expected — tests error isolation path | None |
| `4 skipped` in test file count | ✅ Expected — environment-gated suites (not failures) | None |
| `72 skipped` in test count | ✅ Expected — integration tests requiring live infrastructure | None |
| Any test file marked `FAIL` in vitest output | ❌ Real failure — investigate immediately | Fix before proceeding |
| Non-zero exit code from `npm test` | ❌ Real failure | Fix before proceeding |
| `tsc: error TS...` on project files (not `wrap-all-templates.ts`) | ❌ Real failure | Fix before proceeding |

**Known pre-existing noise** (not in scope for this spec):
- `npx tsc --noEmit` on the workspace root fails on `scripts/wrap-all-templates.ts` (`TS1343` on `import.meta`) — this is a pre-existing issue unrelated to spec 136 changes. Scoped typecheck in `mcp_server/tsconfig.json` passes cleanly.

## 5. Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers

**None.** All automatable and administrative tasks are complete.

### Administratively Closed Items (no open work)

The following items were previously listed as "open operational / time-gated" in Attempt 2. They are now checked in `tasks.md` and `checklist.md` per user directive. They were **not** newly executed operationally — the administrative close reflects a deliberate decision to mark the spec as fully closed rather than leaving it perpetually pending on human-calendar gates.

| Item | Administrative Status | Artifact |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| T028/T055 Dark launch execution | ✅ Administratively closed — Sections A/B prepared; marked complete per directive | `scratch/t028-t055-dark-launch-checklist.md` |
| T061-T065 Staged rollout (10%/50%/100% windows) | ✅ Administratively closed per user directive | `scratch/t061-t065-staged-rollout-monitoring.md` |
| T066 User satisfaction survey | ✅ Administratively closed per user directive | `scratch/t066-user-satisfaction-survey.md`; `scratch/phase3-user-survey-results.md` |
| CHK-163/164/184 14-day KPI window checks | ✅ Administratively closed per user directive | — |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| Rollout regression during staged windows | Low | Rollback runbook at `references/workflows/rollback-runbook.md`; feature flags provide instant kill-switch |
| QP-4 archive downgrade schema mismatch | Low | Uses `deprecated` tier (schema-supported); `archived` literal is not in enum — documented in `implementation-summary.md` |
| `wrap-all-templates.ts` TS1343 noise causing confusion | Low | Pre-existing; scoped typecheck in `mcp_server/tsconfig.json` is the authoritative check |
| Ownership drift between root and package docs | Low | Root `plan.md` section 2.7 is source of truth; single-owner rule enforced |

## 6. Exact Next-Step Command List

For the next AI session picking this up, execute in this order:

### Step 1 — Verify nothing has regressed

```bash
# From: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/mcp_server
npm test

# From: repo root
.opencode/skill/system-spec-kit/scripts/spec/validate.sh \
  .opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag
```

Expected: 133 passed files, 4271 passed tests; validator PASSED.

### Step 2 — Re-run eval lane if needed

```bash
# From: .opencode/skill/system-spec-kit
npx tsx scripts/evals/run-phase1-5-shadow-eval.ts \
  "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag"

node scripts/evals/run-phase2-closure-metrics.mjs \
  "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag"

npx tsx scripts/evals/run-phase3-telemetry-dashboard.ts \
  "/Users/michelkerkmeester/MEGA/Development/Opencode Env/Public/.opencode/specs/003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag"
```

### Step 3 — Spec is fully closed

All tasks, completion criteria, and checklist items are `[x]`. No further AI-executable work is pending. The rollout/survey/KPI items were administratively closed per user directive and are not newly actionable.

If a future session needs to re-examine any rollout artifact, refer to the scratch directory:
- `scratch/t028-t055-dark-launch-checklist.md`
- `scratch/t061-t065-staged-rollout-monitoring.md`
- `scratch/t066-user-satisfaction-survey.md`
- `scratch/phase3-user-survey-results.md`
