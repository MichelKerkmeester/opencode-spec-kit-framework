## What Was Built

This package already documented closed execution for Phase 2 and Phase 3 task ranges. This update does not change that execution record. It adds missing Level 3+ artifacts and ANCHOR tags required for structured retrieval and validator compliance.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| decision-record.md | Created | Add required package-level ADR coverage with root delegation |
| implementation-summary.md | Created | Add required Level 3+ implementation summary artifact |
| tasks.md | Modified | Add ANCHOR tags for structured retrieval |
| checklist.md | Modified | Add ANCHOR tags for structured retrieval |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Preserve existing Phase 2/3 closure narrative | Keep historical execution intent unchanged |
| Keep canonical architecture ADRs in parent `../decision-record.md` | Maintain single source of truth for cross-package architecture decisions |

<!-- ANCHOR:verification -->
## Verification

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Manual | Pass | Documentation structure and anchors verified |
| Unit | Skip | No package-local code changes |
| Integration | Skip | No runtime behavior changes in this update |

<!-- ANCHOR:limitations -->
## Known Limitations

This file records documentation compliance updates only; it does not add new execution evidence beyond the existing package artifacts. For the substantive project-wide implementation summary, see `../implementation-summary.md`.
