# Verification Checklist: OpenCode Documentation Quality Upgrade

<!-- SPECKIT_LEVEL: 3 -->
<!-- SPECKIT_TEMPLATE_SOURCE: checklist | v2.2 -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:protocol -->
## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling | Completion Impact |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **[P0]** | HARD BLOCKER | Cannot claim done until complete |
| **[P1]** | Required | Must complete OR get user approval |
| **[P2]** | Optional | Can defer with documented reason |

<!-- /ANCHOR:protocol -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:pre-impl -->
## Pre-Implementation

- [x] CHK-001 [P0] Requirements documented in spec.md
- [x] CHK-002 [P0] Technical approach defined in plan.md
- [x] CHK-003 [P1] Dependencies identified and available

<!-- /ANCHOR:pre-impl -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:docs -->
## Documentation Quality

- [x] CHK-010 [P0] All 85 target files modified (Verified: Git diff shows 85 files changed across spec 122 + untracked changelog files)
- [x] CHK-011 [P0] No superlatives or marketing language remain (Verified: Grep search across all modified files confirms superlatives removed)
- [x] CHK-012 [P0] Technical content preserved in all changes (Verified: Manual review confirms all technical instructions, code examples, and critical content retained)
- [x] CHK-013 [P1] Style consistency applied (Oxford comma removal, em dash reduction, terminology standardization)
- [x] CHK-014 [P1] Prose tightened across all files (unnecessary words removed)
- [x] CHK-015 [P2] Cross-references validated (no broken links)

<!-- /ANCHOR:docs -->

---

## Version Management

- [x] CHK-020 [P0] sk-documentation SKILL.md version bumped to 1.0.6.0 (Verified: File shows version 1.0.6.0 in metadata block)
- [x] CHK-021 [P1] Version change properly documented
- [x] CHK-022 [P2] Version follows semantic versioning pattern

---

## Template Updates

- [x] CHK-030 [P1] readme_template.md restructured (+191 lines)
- [x] CHK-031 [P1] Template improvements maintain compatibility with existing usage
- [x] CHK-032 [P2] Template tested with sample documentation creation

---

## Configuration

- [x] CHK-040 [P0] Antigravity config removed from opencode.json (-78 lines) (Verified: Config file no longer contains antigravity server references)
- [x] CHK-041 [P1] package.json updated for config changes
- [x] CHK-042 [P1] bun.lock updated for dependency changes
- [x] CHK-043 [P0] No broken configuration references remain (Verified: System validation confirms no references to removed antigravity config)

---

## Content Verification

- [x] CHK-050 [P0] Line changes: ~4,864 total LOC changed (+2,649/−2,215, net +434 increase) (Verified: Git diff stat confirms net increase, not reduction as originally planned)
- [x] CHK-051 [P0] All technical instructions preserved (Verified: Diff review shows no deletions of procedural instructions or workflow steps)
- [x] CHK-052 [P0] All code examples preserved (Verified: All code blocks remain intact with no functional changes)
- [x] CHK-053 [P0] All critical warnings and notes preserved (Verified: All ⚠️, ⛔, and CRITICAL markers remain in place)
- [x] CHK-054 [P1] Markdown formatting valid in all files
- [x] CHK-055 [P1] File structure intact (no broken headings, lists, tables)

---

<!-- ANCHOR:file-org -->
## File Organization

- [x] CHK-060 [P1] All changes committed to proper locations
- [x] CHK-061 [P1] No temporary files in root directory
- [x] CHK-062 [P2] Spec folder properly organized with documentation
