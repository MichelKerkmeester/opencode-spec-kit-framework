<!-- ANCHOR:p0-blockers -->
## P0 - Blockers

- [x] W2-CHK-001 Root checks `CHK-223-224` mapped and verifiable in this package. [Evidence: `scratch/c136-04-dark-launch-evidence.md`, `scratch/c136-05-staged-rollout-evidence.md`]
- [x] W2-CHK-002 Wave 1 dependency and handoff inputs are explicit (`../004-post-research-wave-1-governance-foundations/`). [Evidence: Wave 1 package complete, handoff W1-020 delivered]
- [x] W2-CHK-003 Sync/async operationalization contract is explicit for rollout evidence (foreground deterministic response, durable async workers). [Evidence: `scratch/c136-05-staged-rollout-evidence.md` covers sync/async separation]
- [x] W2-CHK-004 Wave 1 typed contract bundle (trace envelope + degraded-mode schema + routing policy) version-pinned and available before Wave 2 execution (Definition of Ready pre-condition from plan.md). [Evidence: Wave 1 contract artifacts delivered via W1-020]
- [x] W2-CHK-005 `C136-12` telemetry expansion outputs confirmed available from Wave 1 before Wave 2 stage-gate interpretation. [Evidence: `mcp_server/lib/telemetry/retrieval-telemetry.ts` from Wave 1]

<!-- ANCHOR:p1-required -->
## P1 - Required

- [x] W2-CHK-010 Root check `CHK-225` mapped and verifiable in this package. [Evidence: `mcp_server/lib/storage/mutation-ledger.ts` + tests]
- [x] W2-CHK-011 Backlog IDs `C136-04`, `C136-05`, and `C136-11` are mapped in `../tasks.md`. [Evidence: root tasks.md references all IDs]
- [x] W2-CHK-012 Wave 3 handoff is explicit in package and root docs. [Evidence: W2-030 handoff task complete]
- [x] W2-CHK-013 Execution status is explicit and synchronized with root completion claims. [Evidence: all W2 tasks marked complete with evidence]
- [x] W2-CHK-014 Deterministic exact-operation tooling evidence is present (count/status/dependency checks separated from semantic retrieval). [Evidence: `scratch/c136-04-dark-launch-evidence.md` deterministic gate-check outputs]
- [x] W2-CHK-015 Append-only mutation ledger evidence includes required fields (`reason`, `prior_hash`, `new_hash`, `linked_memory_ids`, `decision_meta`). [Evidence: `mcp_server/lib/storage/mutation-ledger.ts` + tests verify all metadata fields]
- [x] W2-CHK-016 This package's documentation set (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md) confirmed referenced by root CHK-230. [Evidence: root checklist cross-reference verified]
<!-- /ANCHOR:p1-required -->

<!-- ANCHOR:p2-optional -->
## P2 - Optional

- [x] W2-CHK-020 Package-level risk notes stay aligned with root `../plan.md`. [Evidence: risk notes consistent with root plan]
