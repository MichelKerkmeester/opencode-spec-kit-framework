## 2. Quality Gates

### Definition of Ready
- Root mapping to `T000a-T028` and `T027a-T027o` confirmed.
- Dataset strategy confirmed (100-query bootstrap, 1000-query hardening).
- Token-usage three-tier contract accepted.
- Session lifecycle contract scope confirmed.

### Definition of Done
- `T000l` and `T027o` complete.
- Hard gates pass: correlation >= 0.90 and redaction FP <= 15%.
- Handoff artifacts published to `../scratch/` for package 002.

## 3. Execution Model

| Workstream | Root Tasks | Duration | Output |
|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| Hook pipeline | `T000a-T000d` | 2-3 days | Non-blocking post-dispatch callback pipeline |
| tokenUsage contract | `T000e-T000g` | 1-2 days | Three-tier fallback contract and tests |
| Phase 0 dataset bootstrap | `T000h-T000k` | 1 day | `eval-dataset-100.json` with baseline capture |
| Core automation | `T001-T028` | 1-2 weeks | Event decay, session boost, pressure policy |
| Hardening gate | `T027a-T027o` | 4-5 days | 1000-query eval, redaction calibration, go/no-go |
<!-- /ANCHOR:execution-model -->

<!-- ANCHOR:milestones -->
## 4. Milestones

| Milestone | Exit Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|
| FDN-M0 | `T000l` complete (Phase 0 sign-off) |
| FDN-M1 | `T028` complete with Phase 1 dark launch |
| FDN-M1.5 | `T027o` complete; all hard gates passed for Phase 2 handoff |
<!-- /ANCHOR:milestones -->

<!-- ANCHOR:risk-register -->
## 5. Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Dataset quality too weak in Phase 0 | Misleading Phase 1 confidence | Treat 100-query set as indicative only; enforce 1000-query hard gate |
| tokenUsage often absent from callers | Pressure policy under-activation | Three-tier fallback + explicit WARN when inactive |
| Redaction false positives | Loss of useful git/runtime context | Calibrate on 50 outputs + SHA/UUID exclusions before Phase 2 |
| Session lifecycle ambiguity | Wrong decay/boost behavior on resume | Contract + integration test in `T027k-T027n` |
<!-- /ANCHOR:risk-register -->

<!-- ANCHOR:dependencies -->
## 6. Dependencies and Handoff

- Consumes canonical requirements and acceptance criteria from `../spec.md`.
- Primary ownership in overlap set: this package owns acceptance for `REQ-014` and `REQ-017`; package 002 consumes these outputs.
- On completion, unlocks package `../002-extraction-rollout-phases-2-3/`.
- Handoff bundle:
  - `../scratch/eval-dataset-1000.json`
  - `../scratch/phase1-5-eval-results.md`
  - `../scratch/redaction-calibration.md`
<!-- /ANCHOR:dependencies -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:governance -->
## 7. Governance Notes

- Level 3+ package planning is maintained here.
- `decision-record.md` remains root-only at `../decision-record.md`.
- `implementation-summary.md` present as compliance normalization record; substantive summary at `../implementation-summary.md`.

## 8. Planning Status

Planning-only package. No implementation has started.

<!-- ANCHOR:technical-context -->
## Technical Context

| Context Item | Current State | Package Implication |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Root requirement baseline | Defined in `../spec.md` | Package 001 owns foundation acceptance for overlap items `REQ-014` and `REQ-017` |
| Task inventory | Defined in `../tasks.md` | Execution scope is constrained to `T000a-T028` and `T027a-T027o` |
| Validation inventory | Defined in `../checklist.md` | Gate mapping must stay aligned to `CHK-125-139` and `CHK-155-159b` |
| Downstream dependency | Package `../002-extraction-rollout-phases-2-3/` | Phase 2 start is blocked until hardening gate completion |
<!-- /ANCHOR:technical-context -->

<!-- ANCHOR:architecture -->
## Architecture

Foundation delivery architecture is a gated sequence: prerequisite wiring, core automation, then hardening verification. The architecture intentionally separates indicative confidence signals (Phase 0 and Phase 1) from hard go/no-go gates (Phase 1.5) so package 002 receives explicit readiness evidence rather than inferred readiness.
<!-- /ANCHOR:architecture -->

---

<!-- ANCHOR:implementation -->
## Implementation

Implementation follows the root task mapping and keeps package boundaries explicit so this package can be audited independently while remaining synchronized with root completion semantics.
<!-- /ANCHOR:implementation -->

---

## Phase 0 - Prerequisite Bootstrap

Deliver `T000a-T000l` to establish callback pipeline behavior, token usage contract handling, and initial baseline dataset capture used by later hardening validation.

## Phase 1 - Core Cognitive Automation

Deliver `T001-T028` with event decay, session boost, and pressure policy behavior mapped to root acceptance and verification artifacts.

## Phase 1.5 - Hardening Gate

Deliver `T027a-T027o` and enforce hard gates (rank correlation and redaction calibration) before handing package outputs to package 002.

## AI Execution Protocol

### Pre-Task Checklist

- Confirm package-to-root mapping for `T000a-T028` and `T027a-T027o` is still current.
- Confirm dependency lock to package `../002-extraction-rollout-phases-2-3/` is unchanged.
- Confirm hardening thresholds (`>= 0.90` correlation, `<= 15%` redaction false positives) remain unchanged.
- Confirm handoff artifacts path remains `../scratch/`.

### Execution Rules

| Rule | Description | Trigger | Action |
|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| FDN-ER-001 | Preserve root ownership boundaries | Any package update | Keep requirement ownership unchanged (`REQ-014`, `REQ-017`) |
| FDN-ER-002 | Enforce hardening gate before handoff | Before Phase 2 handoff | Block handoff unless `T027o` gate criteria are met |
| FDN-ER-003 | Keep root references synchronized | Any document edit | Reconcile references to `../spec.md`, `../plan.md`, `../tasks.md`, `../checklist.md` |

### Status Reporting Format

Use: `Status: <Planned|In Progress|Blocked|Complete> | Scope: <task IDs> | Evidence: <artifact paths> | Next: <next action>`.

### Blocked Task Protocol

If blocked, record `BLOCKED` status with blocker type, impacted task IDs, and expected unblock condition; keep package `002` dependency note updated until blocker is cleared.
