## ADR-001: Package-Local ADR Delegation to Parent Canonical Record

### Context

This package is declared as Level 3+ and must include `decision-record.md` for compliance checks. Existing package governance text establishes that canonical architecture decisions live in the parent `../decision-record.md`.

### Constraints
- Preserve the current package intent and avoid rewriting architecture decisions.
- Avoid duplicating parent ADR content to reduce drift risk.
- Satisfy validator requirements for Level 3+ file presence.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-decision -->
### Decision

**Summary**: Add a package-local decision record that explicitly delegates canonical architecture authority to `../decision-record.md`.

**Details**: This file documents only the delegation model and package-level compliance intent. Root ADRs remain the source of truth for implementation architecture, and this package keeps its execution/handoff scope unchanged.

### Alternatives Considered

| Option | Pros | Cons | Score |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| **Local delegation record (chosen)** | Meets validator requirements, preserves package intent, avoids duplication | Adds one lightweight file to maintain | 9/10 |
| Keep file absent | No new file | Fails Level 3+ validation | 1/10 |
| Copy all parent ADRs into package | Local completeness | High duplication and divergence risk | 3/10 |

**Why Chosen**: It is the smallest change that resolves compliance errors while preserving existing documentation intent.

<!-- ANCHOR:adr-001-consequences -->
### Consequences

**Positive**:
- Level 3+ file requirements are satisfied.
- Canonical architecture governance remains centralized in the parent spec.

**Negative**:
- Readers must follow cross-reference to the parent ADR for full architectural detail.

**Risks**:
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Local and parent governance wording drifts | Low | Keep this file delegation-focused and update with parent ADR policy changes |

### Five Checks Evaluation

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Necessary? | PASS | Missing file produced validator errors |
| 2 | Beyond Local Maxima? | PASS | Evaluated absence, duplication, and delegation options |
| 3 | Sufficient? | PASS | Minimal delegation ADR resolves compliance target |
| 4 | Fits Goal? | PASS | Goal is documentation compliance without scope change |
| 5 | Open Horizons? | PASS | Future ADR changes remain centralized at parent |

**Checks Summary**: 5/5 PASS

### Implementation

**Affected Systems**:
- `001-foundation-phases-0-1-1-5/decision-record.md`
- `../decision-record.md` (referenced canonical source)

**Rollback**: Remove this file only if folder level is changed away from Level 3+ and validator requirements are revised.
