## Verification Protocol

| Priority | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| P0 | Hard blocker |
| P1 | Required unless explicitly deferred |
| P2 | Optional optimization |
<!-- /ANCHOR:verification-protocol -->

<!-- ANCHOR:p0-blockers -->
## P0 - Blockers

- [x] W3-CHK-001 Root check `CHK-227` mapped and verifiable in this package. [Evidence: `scratch/c136-06-survey-outcomes.md` + `scratch/c136-07-kpi-closure-evidence.md`]
- [x] W3-CHK-002 Wave 2 dependency and handoff inputs are explicit (`../005-post-research-wave-2-controlled-delivery/`). [Evidence: Wave 2 package complete, handoff W2-030 delivered]
- [x] W3-CHK-003 Capability truth matrix generation source is explicit and runtime-backed (not manually assembled). [Evidence: `scratch/c136-07-kpi-closure-evidence.md` includes matrix snapshots from runtime data]
<!-- /ANCHOR:p0-blockers -->

<!-- ANCHOR:p1-required -->
## P1 - Required

- [x] W3-CHK-010 Root check `CHK-228` mapped and verifiable in this package. [Evidence: `scratch/c136-07-kpi-closure-evidence.md` KPI closure]
- [x] W3-CHK-011 Backlog IDs `C136-06` and `C136-07` are mapped in `../tasks.md`. [Evidence: root tasks.md references both IDs]
- [x] W3-CHK-012 Execution status is explicit and synchronized with root completion claims. [Evidence: all W3 tasks marked complete with evidence]
- [x] W3-CHK-013 Root references remain synchronized across `../spec.md`, `../plan.md`, `../tasks.md`, and `../checklist.md`. [Evidence: root documents reference Wave 3 package]
- [x] W3-CHK-014 Capability truth matrix snapshots are captured longitudinally (start/mid/end closure window) and included in closure packet. [Evidence: `scratch/c136-07-kpi-closure-evidence.md` includes longitudinal snapshots]
- [x] W3-CHK-015 Closure note includes matrix drift analysis and recommendation rationale. [Evidence: `scratch/c136-07-kpi-closure-evidence.md` drift analysis section]
- [x] W3-CHK-016 This package's documentation set (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, checklist.md) confirmed referenced by root CHK-231. [Evidence: root checklist cross-reference verified]
- [x] W3-CHK-017 Capability truth matrix artifact format is consumable by docs/handover workflows (not raw data only). [Evidence: closure packet includes handover-consumable format]
<!-- /ANCHOR:p1-required -->

<!-- ANCHOR:p2-optional -->
## P2 - Optional

- [x] W3-CHK-020 Package-level risk notes stay aligned with root `../plan.md`. [Evidence: risk notes consistent with root plan]
<!-- /ANCHOR:p2-optional -->
