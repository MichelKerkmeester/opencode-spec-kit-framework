## Decision Record Delegation

This phase package delegates decision records to the parent spec folder.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Canonical Source | `../decision-record.md` |
| Reason | Phase packages do not maintain independent ADRs; all architectural decisions are recorded at root level to prevent fragmentation |
