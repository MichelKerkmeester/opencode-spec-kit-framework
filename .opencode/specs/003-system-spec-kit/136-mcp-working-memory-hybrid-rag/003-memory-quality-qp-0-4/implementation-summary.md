## What Was Built

This package remains the memory-quality documentation and synchronization artifact for QP-0 through QP-4 scope. No new runtime implementation was introduced in this folder by this update. Work performed here is limited to required documentation artifacts and ANCHOR coverage.

### Files Changed

| File | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| decision-record.md | Created | Provide required Level 3+ package-local ADR record |
| implementation-summary.md | Created | Provide required Level 3+ implementation summary file |

<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep package scope unchanged | Preserve existing quality-phase intent and mappings |
| Reference parent `../decision-record.md` as canonical architecture source | Avoid duplicate ADR drift across sibling packages |
