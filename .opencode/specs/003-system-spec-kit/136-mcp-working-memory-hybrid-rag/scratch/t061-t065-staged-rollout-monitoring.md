Status: AWAITING HUMAN EXECUTION (T061-T065 open/pending, blocked on T055)
Prepared: 2026-02-19

Complete each stage in order. Do NOT skip a stage or shorten monitoring windows.
All gate metrics must PASS before advancing to the next stage.

## Rollback Trigger Reference

Trigger rollback immediately if ANY of the following are observed:
  - Error rate increases > 5% vs dark-launch baseline
  - Context errors exceed 25% of pre-boost baseline
  - MRR ratio drops below 0.90x baseline
  - P0-level crash or data integrity issue
  - Pressure activation rate exceeds 85% sustained over 6h

Rollback command (quick reference):
  unset SPECKIT_SESSION_BOOST SPECKIT_PRESSURE_POLICY SPECKIT_EVENT_DECAY
  unset SPECKIT_AUTO_RESUME SPECKIT_EXTRACTION SPECKIT_CAUSAL_BOOST
  (or set all to "false")
  Restart MCP server.
