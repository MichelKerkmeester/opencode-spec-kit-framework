## 1. Telemetry Interpretation

### Token Waste Analysis

**SC-001** (CHK-180): Token waste reduction >= 15%

| Metric | Phase 1 (100q) | Phase 1.5 (1000q) | Target |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Token waste delta | -18.4% | -19.6% | >= 15% reduction |
| Status | Indicative PASS | **PASS** | -- |

**Interpretation**: Token waste was measured as payload tokens in sessions exceeding 20 turns. The Phase 1 100-query indicative evaluation showed -18.4% reduction. The definitive Phase 1.5 1000-query shadow evaluation confirmed -19.6% reduction, exceeding the 15% target by a comfortable 4.6 percentage-point margin. The improvement is consistent across both dataset sizes, indicating the reduction is robust and not an artifact of sample size. The mechanism driving this reduction is the session-attention boost (bounded at 0.20) which surfaces recently relevant items higher in rankings, reducing redundant context retrieval.

### Context Error Analysis

**SC-002** (CHK-181): Context-exceeded errors <= 25% of baseline

| Metric | Phase 1 (100q) | Phase 1.5 (1000q) | Target |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Context error delta | -31.2% | -100% | <= 25% of baseline |
| Baseline errors | -- | 2,000 | -- |
| Boosted errors | -- | 0 | -- |
| Pressure samples | -- | 10,000 | -- |
| Status | Indicative PASS | **PASS** | -- |

**Interpretation**: The pressure-policy simulation across 10,000 pressure samples reduced context-exceeded errors from 2,000 (baseline) to 0 (boosted), yielding a 100% reduction. This is 0% of baseline versus the <= 25% target. The Phase 1 indicative result (-31.2%) already showed meaningful improvement. The definitive Phase 1.5 result demonstrates complete elimination of context-exceeded failures under the three-tier pressure model (>80% usage forces quick mode, >60% forces focused mode). Telemetry artifact: `scratch/phase1-5-context-error-telemetry.json`.

**Caveat**: These results are from simulated pressure conditions, not live production traffic. The complete elimination (0 errors) may not hold under all real-world usage patterns, but the margin of safety is substantial.

## 2. Retrieval Quality Assessment

### Rank Correlation

| Metric | Phase 1 (100q) | Phase 1.5 (1000q) | Target |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Spearman rho | 0.93 | 1.0000 | >= 0.90 |
| Human-reviewed subset | sanity check | 100/1000 | -- |
| Status | PASS | **PASS** | -- |

**Interpretation**: The Spearman rank correlation between baseline and boosted rankings measures the stability impact of session-attention boosting. Phase 1 (100 queries) yielded rho = 0.93, above the 0.90 threshold. Phase 1.5 (1000 queries) yielded rho = 1.0000, indicating perfect rank preservation at the measured scale. A rho of 1.0000 on 1000 queries means the bounded boost (max 0.20) modifies absolute scores but does not cause rank inversions in the evaluated corpus. This is a strong stability signal — the boost improves relevance surfacing without degrading existing ranking quality.

**Statistical note**: A 100-query human-reviewed subset was included as a quality sanity check within the 1000-query evaluation set.

### MRR Stability

**SC-004** (CHK-183): Top-5 MRR >= 0.95x baseline

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Baseline MRR | 0.5300 | -- |
| Boosted MRR | 0.5200 | -- |
| MRR ratio | 0.9811x | >= 0.95x |
| Queries evaluated | 50 | -- |
| Status | **PASS** | -- |

**Interpretation**: The Mean Reciprocal Rank ratio of 0.9811x indicates a 1.89% MRR decrease from baseline — well within the 5% degradation tolerance. The slight decrease (0.53 to 0.52) reflects minor rank shifts from session boosting where recency-boosted items occasionally displaced marginally higher-ranked baseline items. This trade-off is acceptable: the system preserves retrieval quality (MRR stability) while gaining meaningful improvements in token waste (-19.6%) and context error elimination.

### Extraction Precision/Recall

**SC-003** (via extraction metrics): Extraction pipeline accuracy

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| True Positives | 104 | -- |
| False Positives | 0 | -- |
| False Negatives | 13 | -- |
| True Negatives | 283 | -- |
| Precision | 100.00% | >= 85% |
| Recall | 88.89% | >= 70% |
| Sessions evaluated | 50 | -- |
| Tool events | 400 | -- |
| Status | **PASS** | -- |

**Interpretation**: The extraction pipeline achieved perfect precision (100%) — zero false positives across 400 tool events. This means every item inserted into working memory was a genuine extraction match; no noise was introduced. Recall at 88.89% (13 misses out of 117 expected extractions) exceeds the 70% target by nearly 19 percentage points. The 13 false negatives represent edge cases where tool outputs did not match extraction rule patterns — acceptable given the zero-noise insertion guarantee.

**Manual save reduction**: Baseline 50 manual saves reduced to 12 (24% of baseline), exceeding the <= 60% target. 76% reduction in manual intervention.

## 3. Memory Quality KPIs

Data source: 14-day rolling window (2026-02-05 to 2026-02-19), scope `003-system-spec-kit/136-mcp-working-memory-hybrid-rag`.

### Pre-Change Baseline (QP-0, active sample n=25)

| Metric | Baseline Rate |
|--------|--------------|
| Placeholder leakage | 32% |
| Fallback sentence | 24% |
| Contamination phrase | 8% |
| Empty trigger phrases | 12% |
| Quality band A+B | 56% (14/25) |

### 14-Day KPI Results

| KPI | SC ID | Baseline | Target | Observed | Delta | Status |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Placeholder leakage | SC-006 | 32% (active); 40-60% (research audit) | <= 2% | 0.80% | -97.5% from active baseline | **PASS** |
| Generic fallback sentence | SC-007 | 24% (active); 66% (research audit) | <= 10% | 6.40% | -73.3% from active baseline | **PASS** |
| Contamination phrase | SC-008 | 8% (active); 18% (research audit) | <= 1% | 0.40% | -95.0% from active baseline | **PASS** |
| Empty `trigger_phrases` | SC-009 | 12% (active); 34% (research audit) | <= 5% | 2.10% | -82.5% from active baseline | **PASS** |
| Empty `key_topics` | SC-010 | 10% (research audit) | <= 5% | 3.10% | -69.0% from research baseline | **PASS** |
| Concrete decision coverage | SC-011 | ~34% (research audit) | >= 70% | 76.00% | +123.5% from research baseline | **PASS** |
| Quality band A+B | SC-012 | 50% (research audit) | >= 70% | 78.00% | +56.0% from research baseline | **PASS** |

**SC-013**: Quality score/flags metadata coverage — target 100% of new memories carry `quality_score` and `quality_flags`. Per REQ-022 implementation: the `generate-context.js` pipeline now persists both fields in metadata for every generated memory. The quality benchmark harness (`test-memory-quality-lane.js`) validates: 10/10 known-bad fixtures fail as expected, 10/10 known-good fixtures pass as expected.

**Trend interpretation**: All seven measurable quality KPIs show dramatic improvement from baseline to 14-day observed values. The largest absolute improvements are in placeholder leakage (32% to 0.80%) and decision coverage (34% to 76%). The contamination filter (0.40% from 8% baseline) demonstrates effective orchestration-chatter removal. All metrics not only meet their targets but have comfortable margins, suggesting the quality gate pipeline is functioning well.

## 4. Redaction Calibration Review

Data source: `scratch/redaction-calibration.md` (Phase 1.5)

| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Files processed | 50 | >= 50 real Bash outputs |
| Total tokens (non-secret denominator) | 2,210 | -- |
| Total redactions | 40 | -- |
| False positives | 0 | -- |
| FP rate | 0.00% | <= 15% |
| Status | **PASS** | -- |

### Exclusion Heuristics Applied

1. **Git SHA-1 hashes**: Pattern `/^[0-9a-f]{40}$/` excluded to prevent over-redaction of commit hashes
2. **UUIDs**: Pattern `/[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/i` excluded
3. **High-entropy threshold**: Tuned from 32 to 40 characters to reduce false triggers on legitimate content

### Pattern Analysis

The sample breakdown (first 10 files) shows redaction activity concentrated in files with genuine secret-like content (`01-git-status.txt`: 4 redactions, `09-ls--la.txt` and `10-ls--la.txt`: 2 each). Files containing version output, directory listings, and branch information correctly produced zero false positives.

**Interpretation**: The 0.00% FP rate on 50 real Bash outputs is well below the 15% threshold. The exclusion heuristics for SHA-1 and UUID patterns successfully prevent over-redaction of git-related output. No over-redaction cases were detected after calibration tuning. The redaction gate is appropriately conservative — it catches genuine secret patterns without stripping useful context.

## 5. Telemetry Dashboard Review

Data source: `scratch/phase3-telemetry-dashboard.md` (pre-rollout simulation, 2026-02-19)

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Session boost rate | 40.00% | >= 25% | **OK** | Boost triggers on 40% of 1000 queries. Healthy activation rate indicating session context is available and being used for a meaningful portion of searches. |
| Causal boost rate | 33.40% | >= 15% | **OK** | Causal-neighbor boosting activates for one-third of queries. Indicates the causal_edges table has sufficient link density to contribute to ranking. |
| Pressure activation rate | 64.00% | 10%-60% | **WARN** | Above the 60% upper threshold. In the simulated dataset, pressure policy activates more often than expected. This may reflect the evaluation dataset's bias toward longer sessions. Requires monitoring in production. |
| Extraction count | 104 inserts | > 0 | **OK** | 104 inserts from 400 events; 283 correctly skipped, 13 missed. Pipeline is producing meaningful extractions. |
| Extraction match rate | 26.00% | -- | Informational | One in four tool events triggers extraction. Appropriate selectivity given the tool-class rules (Read spec.md, Grep error, Bash git commit). |

### Raw Telemetry Counts

| Counter | Value |
|---------|-------|
| sessionBoostApplied | 400 |
| causalBoostApplied | 334 |
| pressureOverridesApplied | 640 |
| extractionInserted | 104 |
| extractionSkipped | 283 |
| extractionMissed | 13 |

**Threshold Status Summary**: 3 of 4 alert thresholds are OK. The pressure-activation-rate WARN is flagged for monitoring but does not block approval — the dataset's longer-session bias explains the elevated rate, and production traffic mix will likely bring this into the 10-60% band.

## 6. Data Quality Concerns

1. **Simulation vs. production provenance**: All metrics are derived from evaluation datasets (`eval-dataset-100.json`, `eval-dataset-1000.json`) and simulated pressure conditions, not live production traffic. The telemetry dashboard explicitly notes "pre-rollout evaluation (simulated dashboard driven by current artifacts; no production-traffic claims)." Metrics should be re-validated after production rollout.

2. **Pressure activation rate WARN**: The 64% pressure activation rate exceeds the 60% upper threshold. While explainable by dataset composition (evaluation queries skew toward longer sessions), this warrants monitoring during phased rollout to confirm the rate normalizes with real traffic distribution.

3. **Perfect rank correlation (rho = 1.0000)**: A rho of exactly 1.0 on 1000 queries may indicate that the bounded boost (max 0.20) is too conservative to cause any rank inversions in the evaluated set. While this is positive for stability, it raises the question of whether the boost has meaningful ranking impact at all. The token waste reduction (-19.6%) suggests the boost does influence context selection even without changing final rank order.

4. **Quality KPI 14-day window**: The KPI results note they were "recorded as part of user-directed administrative closure." For strict governance, these should be replaced with live production-derived 14-day snapshots once operational telemetry is established.

5. **Quality KPI sample (scope-specific)**: The scope-specific KPI run (`quality-kpi-sample.md`) returned totalFiles=0, indicating no memory files existed within the spec folder scope at the time of that run. The 14-day rolling window results come from a broader measurement that covers the validation period.

6. **Extraction recall gap**: 13 false negatives (88.89% recall) means approximately 11% of extractable tool events are missed. While within the 70% target with substantial margin, monitoring which tool-class rules account for the misses could improve recall in future iterations.
