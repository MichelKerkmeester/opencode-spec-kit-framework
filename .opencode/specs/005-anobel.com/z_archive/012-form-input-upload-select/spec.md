# Spec: Form Input Components Enhancement

<!-- ANCHOR:overview -->
## Overview

Enhance form input capabilities with two new components:

1. **Custom Select** - CMS-driven dropdown replacing Finsweet's `fs-selectcustom`
2. **File Upload** - FilePond-based file upload with cloud storage

Both components integrate with the existing Input | Main component structure and Webflow/Formspark form system.

## Part A: CMS-Driven Custom Select

### Problem Statement

Current select implementation uses Finsweet's select attribute which:
- Requires external JS dependency
- Has static/hardcoded options
- Cannot be updated by non-developers
- Adds maintenance overhead

### Solution

Build a custom select component with:
- Native JavaScript (no Finsweet dependency)
- CMS Collection List for dynamic options
- Hidden native `<select>` for form submission
- Full ARIA accessibility support

<!-- ANCHOR:part-b-filepond-file-upload -->
## Part B: FilePond File Upload

### Problem Statement

Current forms have no file upload capability. Users need to:
- Upload CVs/resumes for job applications
- Attach documents to contact forms
- Submit images for service requests

### Solution

Integrate FilePond file upload library with:
- Cloud storage backend (Cloudflare R2 + Worker)
- Image preview for uploaded images
- File type and size validation
- Progress indicator during upload
- File URL submitted with form to Formspark

### Key Findings (Research)

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Formspark does NOT support native file attachments | Must use cloud storage + URL approach |
| `form_submission.js` explicitly skips file inputs | Files converted to URLs before submission |
| Base64 encoding has ~10MB practical limit | Not suitable for larger files |
| User already has Cloudflare account | Use existing infrastructure, single ecosystem |
| Cloudflare R2: FREE egress, 10GB free storage | Most cost-effective at any scale |

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| CMS Collection List nesting issues | Medium | High | Test in Webflow before full implementation |
| Cloudflare Worker configuration errors | Low | High | Test Worker thoroughly before deployment |
| R2 public access misconfigured | Low | High | Verify r2.dev URL works before Webflow integration |
| FilePond styling conflicts | Medium | Low | Use scoped CSS, test thoroughly |
| Large file upload timeouts | Medium | Medium | Set appropriate size limits, show progress |
| Form submission before upload complete | Medium | High | Disable submit until upload done |
