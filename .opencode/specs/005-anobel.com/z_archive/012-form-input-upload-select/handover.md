## 2. Context Transfer

### 2.1 Key Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Set for open instances | O(1) add/delete operations and automatic deduplication | input_select.js - reduced N document listeners to 1 |
| WeakMap for error container cache | Automatic garbage collection when fields removed from DOM | form_validation.js - reduced 5 DOM traversals to 1 |
| Event delegation | Reduced listener count from 2N to 2 per select instance | input_select.js - better performance with many options |
| Cache invalidation on form reset | Ensures fresh DOM lookups after form state changes | form_validation.js - prevents stale cache bugs |

### 2.2 Blockers Encountered
| Blocker | Status | Resolution/Workaround |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Pre-existing version inconsistency for form_submission.js in contact.html | RESOLVED | Fixed version to v1.1.2 to match other HTML files |

## 3. For Next Session

### 3.1 Recommended Starting Point
- **File:** src/2_javascript/z_minified/form/
- **Context:** Upload minified files to R2 CDN for deployment

### 3.2 Priority Tasks Remaining
1. Upload minified files to R2 CDN for deployment
2. Browser testing on live site after CDN update
3. Mark integration items as complete in checklist.md after Webflow deployment

### 3.3 Critical Context to Load
- [ ] Memory file: `memory/04-01-26_13-51__form-input-components.md`
- [ ] Spec file: `spec.md` (all sections)
- [ ] Checklist: `checklist.md` (Summary section shows 72 complete, 44 pending)

## 5. Session Notes

**Session Summary:** Performance optimizations for form scripts (input_select.js shared document listener + event delegation, form_validation.js WeakMap cache)

**What Was Completed:**
- Implemented shared document click listener using Set for open instances tracking
- Implemented event delegation for option click/keydown handlers
- Added WeakMap cache for get_error_container() results
- Added cache invalidation on form reset
- Updated HTML files with new script versions
- Verified minification (42/42 passed)
- Verified runtime tests (42/42 passed)
- Fixed pre-existing version inconsistency for form_submission.js in contact.html
- Saved memory context

**What Remains:**
- Upload minified files to R2 CDN for deployment
- Webflow Designer integration (pending items in checklist)
- Live site testing

**Technical Patterns Used:**
- Singleton listener pattern (shared document click handler)
- Event delegation pattern (option handlers delegated to dropdown container)
- WeakMap caching pattern (error container cache with GC support)
