<!-- ANCHOR:decisions -->
## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Keep the audit wording close to the screenshots | Reduces interpretation drift and preserves the original report intent |
| Store the audit as a single markdown artifact in the spec folder | Makes it easy to link to and use during future implementation work |
