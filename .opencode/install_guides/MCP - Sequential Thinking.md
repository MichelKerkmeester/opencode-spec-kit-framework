## 1. Overview

Sequential Thinking is an official Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables dynamic, reflective problem-solving through structured thought sequences. Unlike rigid frameworks, it allows flexible thinking that can adapt and evolve as understanding deepens.

### Core Principle

> **Install once, verify at each step.** Each phase has a validation checkpoint. Do not proceed until the checkpoint passes.

> **Note:** This is an official MCP server maintained by the Model Context Protocol organization.

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Thought Sequences**: Adjust the number of thoughts as needed during analysis
- **Branching Exploration**: Explore alternative approaches from any thought point
- **Revision Support**: Reconsider and revise previous thoughts when new insights emerge
- **Flexible Structure**: No predefined stages. Adapt the thinking process to your problem
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your position in the thought sequence
- **Zero Installation**: Runs via npx, no manual installation required

### How It Works

```
Start Thinking → Record Thought 1 → Record Thought 2 → ... → Final Conclusion
                      ↓                    ↓
                 [Revise if needed]   [Branch to explore alternatives]
```

The tool supports:
- **Linear progression**: Move through thoughts sequentially
- **Revisions**: Go back and reconsider earlier assumptions
- **Branching**: Explore multiple solution paths simultaneously
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Increase or decrease total thoughts as needed

---

## 2. Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- **Node.js 18 or higher**
  ```bash
  node --version
  # Should show v18.x.x or higher
  ```

- **npm/npx** (included with Node.js)
  ```bash
  npx --version
  ```

- **OpenCode CLI**, **VS Code with GitHub Copilot**, or **Claude Desktop**

### That's It

No additional installation is needed. The server runs via `npx`, which downloads and executes it automatically.

### Validation: `phase_1_complete`

Run these prerequisite checks before continuing:

```bash
node --version    # Must be v18.x or higher
npx --version     # Must return a version number
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] `node --version` returns v18 or higher
- [ ] `npx --version` returns a version number
- [ ] An AI client is available (OpenCode, VS Code Copilot, or Claude Desktop)

❌ **STOP if validation fails** - install or upgrade Node.js 18+ before continuing.

---

## 3. Installation

Sequential Thinking runs via npx. No manual installation is required beyond having Node.js 18+.

### Verify npx Can Reach the Package

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help 2>&1 | head -5
```

This command downloads and runs the package once to confirm connectivity and availability. The first run may take a few seconds while npx fetches the package.

### Validation: `phase_2_complete`

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help 2>&1 | head -5
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Command runs without network errors
- [ ] No `npm ERR!` or `ENOTFOUND` output

❌ **STOP if validation fails** - check your network connection or npm registry access.

### Initialize (No Action Required)

The Sequential Thinking server starts on demand via your MCP configuration. There is no initialization step, no database to create, and no service to start manually. Proceed directly to configuration.

### Validation: `phase_3_complete`

No explicit initialization is required for this package. `phase_3_complete` is satisfied when `phase_2_complete` passes and your config file is ready to be updated in Section 4.

❌ **STOP if validation fails** - do not proceed to configuration until the npx connectivity check succeeds.

---

## 6. Usage

### Invocation

Sequential Thinking is a native MCP tool. Call it directly:

```typescript
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Your current thinking step",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```

### Natural Language Triggers

The AI will typically invoke this tool when you use phrases like:

```
Think through this step by step...
Analyze this systematically...
I need to work through a complex decision about...
Help me reason through this problem...
Think hard about this...
```

### Thinking Patterns

**Linear Analysis:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Thought 3 → Conclusion
```

**With Revision:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Revise Thought 1 → Thought 3 → Conclusion
```

**With Branching:**
```
Thought 1 → Thought 2 → Branch A: Thought 3a → ...
                      ↘ Branch B: Thought 3b → ...
```

### When to Use Sequential Thinking

| Scenario                        | Why It Helps                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Multi-step debugging**        | Standard approaches failed. Systematic analysis needed |
| **Architectural decisions**     | Significant trade-offs require structured evaluation   |
| **Complex refactoring**         | Changes span 3+ files with dependencies                |
| **User requests deep analysis** | Keywords: "think hard", "ultrathink", "analyze deeply" |
| **Unfamiliar territory**        | Need to explore options before committing              |

### When to Skip Sequential Thinking

| Scenario                  | Why Skip                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple fixes**          | Single-file changes with obvious solutions    |
| **Straightforward tasks** | Clear path forward, no trade-offs             |
| **Near context limit**    | Already using significant context             |
| **Speed priority**        | Quick response matters more than thoroughness |
| **Routine operations**    | File operations, simple refactors             |

### Token Cost

**Typical usage:** approximately 1,500 to 2,500 tokens per thinking session.

Consider this overhead when deciding whether to invoke the tool.

## 8. Examples

### Example 1: Basic Analysis

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Analyzing the authentication flow. Current implementation uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage, which has XSS vulnerability concerns.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Alternative approaches: 1) HttpOnly cookies (better security), 2) Session tokens (stateful), 3) Token rotation (complexity trade-off).",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "HttpOnly cookies provide XSS protection with minimal implementation changes. Need to handle CSRF separately.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Conclusion
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Recommendation: Migrate to HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=Strict. Add CSRF token for state-changing requests. Implementation effort: ~4 hours.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 4,
  nextThoughtNeeded: false
})
```

### Example 2: With Revision

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Initial assumption: The performance issue is in the database query.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Query profiling shows 50ms response time, actually quite fast.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Revising Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Revising my earlier assumption: The bottleneck is NOT in the database. Looking at network waterfall, the issue is N+1 API calls from the frontend.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  isRevision: true,
  revisesThought: 1,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Continue with corrected understanding...
```

### Example 3: With Branching

```typescript
// Thought 1
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Need to choose between microservices and monolith for the new e-commerce platform.",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 2 - Branch A: Microservices
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch A - Microservices: Better scalability, independent deployments. But: Team of 5 developers, 3-month timeline. Risk of over-engineering.",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "microservices",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 3 - Branch B: Monolith
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Branch B - Monolith: Faster initial development, simpler deployment. Can extract services later when team and scale grow.",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  branchFromThought: 1,
  branchId: "monolith",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Thought 4 - Compare branches and conclude
sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Comparing branches: Given team size and timeline, monolith wins. Can adopt 'modular monolith' pattern for future extraction.",
  thoughtNumber: 4,
  totalThoughts: 6,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})
```

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Tool Not Appearing

**Problem:** `sequential_thinking_sequentialthinking` tool not visible in your AI client.

**Solutions:**

1. **Restart your AI client** (OpenCode, VS Code, Claude Desktop)

2. **Verify Node.js version**
   ```bash
   node --version  # Must be 18+
   ```

3. **Test npx directly**
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
   ```

4. **Check configuration syntax**
   ```bash
   python3 -m json.tool < opencode.json
   ```

5. **Check for typos in config**
   - Server name: `sequential_thinking` (underscore, not hyphen)
   - Args: `["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]`

### npx Errors

**Problem:** npx fails to run the package.

**Solutions:**

1. **Clear npm cache**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

2. **Check network or proxy settings**
   ```bash
   npm config get proxy
   npm config get https-proxy
   ```

3. **Try global install as fallback**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   ```

### Tool Invocation Fails

**Problem:** Tool appears in the tools list but returns an error when called.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check parameter types**. Ensure `thoughtNumber` and `totalThoughts` are integers, not strings

2. **Verify required parameters**. All four required parameters must be present in every call

3. **Check boolean values**. Use `true` or `false`, not quoted strings

### Timeout or Slow Startup

**Problem:** First invocation of the tool is very slow or times out.

**Cause:** The first `npx` run downloads the package from the npm registry. On a slow network or cold cache, this can take longer than the MCP client's startup timeout.

**Solutions:**

1. **Pre-cache the package** by running it once before starting your AI client:
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking --help
   ```

2. **Check network speed**. If on a restricted or slow network, consider the global install fallback:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
   ```
   Then update your config to use `node` instead of `npx`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcp": {
       "sequential_thinking": {
         "type": "local",
         "command": ["sequential-thinking"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### MCP Server Not in Tools List After Config Change

**Problem:** You updated the configuration file but the tool still does not appear after restarting.

**Cause:** Config file has a JSON syntax error, or the server name does not match what the client expects.

**Solutions:**

1. **Validate JSON syntax**
   ```bash
   python3 -m json.tool < opencode.json
   # or
   python3 -m json.tool < .vscode/mcp.json
   ```

2. **Confirm the server name uses an underscore**
   - Correct: `"sequential_thinking"` (underscore)
   - Incorrect: `"sequential-thinking"` (hyphen)

3. **Fully quit and reopen your AI client**. A simple reload is not always enough for MCP config changes to take effect in VS Code or Claude Desktop

### JSON Validation Error on Config Save

**Problem:** `python3 -m json.tool` reports a parse error on your config file.

**Common causes and fixes:**

| Symptom                          | Likely Cause                      | Fix                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Expecting ',' delimiter`        | Missing comma between properties  | Add the missing comma                                   |
| `Expecting property name`        | Trailing comma after last item    | Remove the trailing comma                               |
| `Expecting value`                | Empty value or unclosed string    | Check for missing closing quote or missing value        |
| `Extra data after JSON document` | Two JSON objects in the same file | Merge into one object rather than two separate blocks   |
